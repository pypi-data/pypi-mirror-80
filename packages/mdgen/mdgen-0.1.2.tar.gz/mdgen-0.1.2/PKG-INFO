# random-markdown-generator

A library to generate random markdown text.

## But why?

I was making a blog web-app that lets its users write blog posts using markdown
syntax. I couldn't find any python package that does this easily. Using the
[`faker`](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) library, I created this package to
make a highly configurable markdown post generator. Additionally, it also
provides an API for creating markdown files using python.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

You must have `python` and `pip` installed on your system, and in you `PATH`.
An activated virtual environment is also recommended.

Using `pip`:

```bash
pip install mdgen
```

Or using poetry:

```bash
poetry add mdgen
```

## Sample usage

```python
from mdgen import MarkdownGenerator
```

## Running the tests

The project uses `pytest` to automate its test suite. To install all
dependencies, ensure you have [`poetry`][1] installed on your system and then run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all dependencies for testing this project in a virtual
environment. Then run all tests using:

```bash
poetry shell
pytest
```

To see test coverage, run:

```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report=html --cache-clear
```

Then open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to see the test coverage.

### Coding style

This project follows the [Pep8](https://pep8.org/) specifications. The maximum
line length has been increased to 90 characters. For the flake8 configuration
used, see [tox.ini](tox.ini). The test suite automatically runs the linters by
default, but you can run just the linting tests.

```bash
flake8
```
