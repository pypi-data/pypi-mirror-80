Description
===========

Print records in column-per-line format. Best used in conjunction with `csvlook <https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripts/csvlook.html>`_

Similar in concept to `xsv flatten <https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv#available-commands>`_, though the output is much different.

TK/TODO: copy text/rationale from `original Github issue <https://github.com/dannguyen/csvkit/issues/1>`_



Basic example and transformation
================================

Given the file at :file:`examples/statecodes.csv`, which looks like this:

.. csv-table::
   :file: ../../examples/statecodes.csv
   :header-rows: 1


And then passing it into :command:`csvflatten`::

    $ csvflatten examples/statecodes.csv


Results in this output::

    fieldname,value
    code,IA
    name,Iowa
    ~~~~~~~~~,
    code,RI
    name,Rhode Island
    ~~~~~~~~~,
    code,TN
    name,Tennessee


Which looks like this as a table:

.. csv-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   fieldname,value
   code,IA
   name,Iowa
   ~~~~~~~~~,""
   code,RI
   name,Rhode Island
   ~~~~~~~~~,""
   code,TN
   name,Tennessee
