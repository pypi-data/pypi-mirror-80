# VERSION: 1.0 ALPHA 

## "approved" branch is volatile and under routine development

Currently targeting generic Python 3.6+, Win32 and Win64 with Borland RAD Studio.  Higher performance for Python is achived when a more complete Python runtime (such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), [Active State](https://platform.activestate.com/Pizza-Team/Top-10-ML-Packages-Win) or *pip install numba*, *pip install pandas*, et al. ) is hosting.

# TLDR

Building on Python all words become infinite precision.  Stack and memory under/over runs are checked.  Virtual Machine OS (VMOS) can be booted from its assembly and retroforth files in addition to pre-compiled .nga images.

# Raison D'√™tre

## Architecture

RETRO has a multilayer design. At the heart of the system is a virtual machine called Nga. This emulates a 32-bit stack processor with a MISC based instruction set.

The core RETRO language is stored as a memory image for Nga. The *image file* contains this and is loaded on startup. It holds all of the compiled words and data and interacts with Nga.

The third layer is the user interface. RETRO doesn't specify any required I/O other than a console log capable of receiving a single character at a time. Each host system can implement this and any additional desired I/O by extending Nga.

# FAQ

## Why is the main branch called approved?

As the major version numbers increment the policy for the default "approved" branch differs.  Consider 1.x to be internal develpment with approved being highly volatile.  The 2.x series is the beta testing/qa version and 3.x being the first stable version.  This comes from a software development addage that v1.0 is released too fast, v2.0 is what v1.0 should have been and v3.0 is the first real version.

All participants in the eco-system can simply clone the reposity and run the python code in the approved branch.  Development/testing will be performed in seperate branches and merged into approved with the changes are ready to go live.
