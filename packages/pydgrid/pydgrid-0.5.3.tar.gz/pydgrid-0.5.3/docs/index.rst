**pydgrid** is an open source (MIT) electric distribution grid simulator. Grid elements are represented in phasor coordinates.
Some futures are:

* Balanced and unbalanced power flow
* Time series simulation
* Time domain simulation


The `source code`_ is hosted on GitHub, and all
contributions and feedback are more than welcome. You can test pydgrid in your
browser using binder, a cloud Jupyter notebook server:
