== First Paragraph ==
AsciiDoc3 computes this text with option docbook51 without errors: 'asciidoc3 -b docbook51 nonvalid_docbook51.txt' You see the new file 'nonvalid_docbook51.xml' which a standard validator deems valid against DocBook51-relaxng schema. Try asciidoc3 -n -a toc -a icons nonvalid_docbook51.txt

------------
python3 /path/to/asciidoc3/tests/docbook_validation/asciidoc3_docbook51_relaxng_validation.py /path/to/asciidoc3/tests/data/nonvalid_docbook51.xml

But it isn't valid as the validation against Schematron DocBook51 reveals.

python3 /path/to/asciidoc3/tests/docbook_validation/asciidoc3_docbook51_schematron_validation.py /path/to/asciidoc3/tests/data/nonvalid_docbook51.xml

To see the html-output, type 'asciidoc3 -n -a toc -a icons nonvalid_docbook51.txt'

Here comes something, nobody cares about this stuff. And now *bold*, and this is _italic_, and the last +monospaced+. After this (hidden +) +
begins a new line.
The german umlauts and two other non-ascii glyphs / letters: äöüÄÖÜß € (euro) ¢ (cent). 

== Second Paragraph
This sample comes with an image. The file name paths xref:nofootnotehere are relative <<nofootnotehere>> to the location[[nofootnotehere,testddr]] of the referring document:
image:redsquare.jpg[caption]
The "caption" in brackets corresponds to HTML alt="caption" and is not seen in the browser. The image is rendered inline; this is perhaps not preferred footnote:[or xref:id_footnote is it?], we have a footnote here.

Another snippet:

image:redsquare.jpg[caption]


and the image at the center of the line. BTW, this is a reference to footnote with a reference ID footnoteref:[id_footnote,plink]. And this is a test[[testanchor,testlabel]] with an unvisible anchor.
 
New line and the image at the beginningfootnote:[footnote without space] of the line. And this is a second test footnoteref:[nofootnotehere] with a footnoteref pointing to nowhere.

New line:

image::redsquare.jpg["caption",align="center"]

We see the image at the center of the line. Link to <<testanchor>>. At the end a link: Visit the https://www.asciidoc3.org[home of asciidoc3]! +
