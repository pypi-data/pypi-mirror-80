comment: |
  This block is mandatory because .name.uses_parts is defined
  automatically by the class definition; thus to override it we need
  to force this code to run.  The other "settings" are undefined by
  default and their definitions will be sought out, so we can use
  non-mandatory blocks to provide their definitions.
