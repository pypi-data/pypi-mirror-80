        # VegasFlow
        
        VegasFlow is a Monte Carlo integration library written in Python and based on the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) framework. It is developed with a focus on speed and efficiency, enabling researchers to perform very expensive calculation as quick and easy as possible.
        
        Some of the key features of VegasFlow are:
        - Integrates efficiently high dimensional functions on single (multi-threading) and multi CPU, single and multi GPU, many GPUs or clusters.
        
        - Compatible with Python, C, C++ or Fortran.
        
        - Implementation of different Monte Carlo algorithms.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        [https://vegasflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest](https://vegasflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
        
        
        ## Installation
        [![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/vegasflow/badges/installer/conda.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/vegasflow)
        [![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/python-vegasflow)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-vegasflow/)
        
        The package can be installed with pip:
        ```bash
        python3 -m pip install vegasflow
        ```
        
        as well as `conda`, from the `conda-forge` channel:
        ```bash
        conda install vegasflow -c conda-forge
        ```
        
        If you prefer a manual installation you can clone the repository and run:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/N3PDF/vegasflow.git
        cd vegasflow
        python setup.py install
        ```
        or if you are planning to extend or develop the code just use:
        ```bash
        python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        
        Below you can find a minimal working example of an integration using VegasFlow
        
        For more complicated examples please see the [documentation](https://vegasflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
        or the [examples](https://github.com/N3PDF/vegasflow/tree/master/examples) folder.
        
        It is possible to install the dependencies required by the examples using:
        
        ```bash
        pip install .[examples]
        ```
        
        ### Minimal Working Example
        ```python
        from vegasflow import vegas_wrapper
        import tensorflow as tf
        
        def integrand(x, **kwargs):
            """ Function:
               x_{1} * x_{2} ... * x_{n}
               x: array of dimension (events, n)
            """
            return tf.reduce_prod(x, axis=1)
        
        dimensions = 8
        iterations = 5
        events_per_iteration = int(1e5)
        vegas_wrapper(integrand, dimensions, iterations, events_per_iteration, compilable=True)
        ```

        some specific example or find any problems at all with the code or the documentation.
