    PyImpetus - interIAMB feature selection algorithm with the conditional mutual
    information part being replaced by a conditional test.

    PyImpetus is a feature selection algorithm that picks features by considering their performance
    both individually as well as conditioned on other selected features. This allows the algorithm
    to not only select the best set of features, it also selects the best set of features
    that play well with each other. For example, the best performing feature might not
    play well with others while the remaining features, when taken together could out-perform
    the best feature. PyImpetus takes this into account and produces the best possible combination.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : estimator object, default=None
        The model which will be used for conditional feature selection. If ``None``,
        will use ``DecisionTreeRegressor`` or ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` depending on the
        ``regression`` param.

    min_feat_proba_thresh : float, default=0.1
        The minimum probability of occurrence that a feature should possess over all
        folds for it to be considered in the final MB.

    p_val_thresh : float, default=0.05
        The p-value below which the feature will considered as a candidate for the final MB.

    k_feats_select : int, default=5
        The number of features to select during growth phase of InterIAMB algorithm.

    num_simul : int, default=100
        Number of train-test splits to perform to check usefulness of each feature.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds in a (Stratified)KFold,
        - CV splitter,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if the ``regression`` param is False and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, StratifiedKFold is used. In all
        other cases, KFold is used.

    regression : bool, default=False
        Defines the task - whether it is regression or classification.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    random_state : int or RandomState instance, default=None
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of CPUs to use to do the computation.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors.

    pre_dispatch : int or str, default='2*n_jobs'
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs
            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned
            - A str, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'

    Attributes
    ----------
    final_feats_ : ndarray or list of ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
        Final list of features.

    Notes
    -----
    PyImpetus is basically the interIAMB algorithm as provided in the paper
    "An Improved IAMB Algorithm for Markov Blanket Discovery" [1]_ with the conditional mutual information
    part being replaced by a conditional test. This test is as described in the paper
    "Testing Conditional Independence in Supervised Learning Algorithms" [2]_.
