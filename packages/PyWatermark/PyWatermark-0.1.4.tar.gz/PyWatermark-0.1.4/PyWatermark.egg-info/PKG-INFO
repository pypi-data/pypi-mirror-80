Description: ## PyWatermark
        
        A python library to watermark your images!
        
        ### Installation
        
        `pip install PyWatermark`
        
        ### Features
        
        This library exploits the usefulness of pillow to watermark images. It's an easy tool if you want to automate the watermarking of many images at once.
        
        ### Usage
        
        ```
        from PyWatermark import waterMarkImages, getAvailableFonts
        
        imageFile = "image.jpg"
        imageOutputPath = "/Desktop" # write your output folder path here 
        text = "Hello World" # Whatever text you want to watermark
        
        # You can adjust the font here from the given fonts or just
        # put in your own font path - a .ttf file
        # Other parameters you can adjust are position, size, opacity
        outFile = waterMarkImages(imageFile, imageOutputPath, text)
        
        print(getAvailableFonts()) # prints out available fonts
        
        ```
