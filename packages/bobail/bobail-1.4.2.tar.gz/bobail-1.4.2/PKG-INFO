Description: A Python3 library that you can use to play a game of bobail. This is just a set of classes that you can use in your code, it's not an interactive shell for the game.
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jasondaming/bobail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/jasondaming/bobail)
        
        # Assumptions
        
        The rules used are from BoardGameAreana (http://en.doc.boardgamearena.com/Gamehelpbobail). This means an 5x5 board.
        
        Each position on the board is numbered 1 to 25. Each move is represented as an array with two values: starting position and ending position. So if you're starting a new game, one of the available moves is `[22, 7]` for player 1.
        
        Each turn (other than the first) will be a series of two moves.  First moving the Bobail then a player token.
        
        # Usage
        
        Create a new game:
        
        ```python
        from bobail.game import Game
        
        game = Game()
        ```
        
        See whose turn it is:
        
        ```python
        game.whose_turn() #1 or 2
        ```
        
        Get the possible moves:
        
        ```python
        game.get_possible_moves() #[[9, 13], [9, 14], [10, 14], [10, 15], [11, 15], [11, 16], [12, 16]]
        ```
        
        Make a move:
        
        ```python
        game.move([9, 13])
        ```
        
        Check if the game is over:
        
        ```python
        game.is_over() #True or False
        ```
        
        Find out who won:
        
        ```python
        game.get_winner() #None or 1 or 2
        ```
        
        Review the move history:
        
        ```python
        game.moves #[[int, int], [int, int], ...]
        ```
        
        Review the pieces on the board:
        
        ```python
        for piece in game.board.pieces:
        	piece.player #1 or 2
        	piece.other_player #1 or 2
        	piece.bobail #True or False
        	piece.captured #True or False
        	piece.position #1-25
        	piece.get_possible_moves() #[[int, int], [int, int], ...]
        ```
        
        # Testing
        
        Run `python3 -m unittest discover` from the root.
