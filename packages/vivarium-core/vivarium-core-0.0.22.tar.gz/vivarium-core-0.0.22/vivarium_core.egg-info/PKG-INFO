        ## Concept
        
        A Vivarium is a "place of life" -- an enclosure for raising organisms in controlled environments for observation or
        research. Typical vivaria include aquariums or terrariums.  The vivarium provided in this repository is a computational
        vivarium for developing multi-scale models of cells in dynamic environments. Its framework is a synthesis of
        hybrid modeling, agent-based modeling, multi-scale simulation, and modular programming.
