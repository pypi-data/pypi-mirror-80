Description: This is my first package and it includes a lot of cool math functions.
        
        I created it because I like maths and to test my python skills.
        
        - Run htam.info() to see general informations about htam and all functions included
        - Run htam.info(function_name) to see detailed informations about that function
        
        If you run into any issue, please send me an email and i will update the package as soon as I can.
        
        I'm still working to improve this package, so, if you have any idea for a future update or a re-styling of an already existing function, please let me know with an email, I would really appreciate it.
        
        Enjoy :)

        ==========
        
        1.1.0 (25/09/2020)
        ------------------
        New Update >>> 2 new math functions:
            14) "htam.rel"  >>>   coprime checker
            15) "htam.tot"  >>>   Euler's Totient function
        
        Various improvement:
            - "htam.pi" function speed of execution increased
            - "htam.floor" function is now literally a 1-line code, maybe i'll remove it in the future
            - now some functions reuses other functions to improve overall performances, in particular:
                - "htam.gcd" is now used into "htam.rel" and into "htam.mod"
                - the new "htam.rel" function replaced some lines of code into "htam.pi"
                - the new "htam.rel" is also used into "htam.tot"
            
        
        1.0.4 (24/09/2020)
        ------------------
        minor corrections
        
        1.0.1 (24/09/2020)
        ------------------
        now each function returns "None" when 1 or more arguments are not valid
        
        1.0.0 (23/09/2020)
        ------------------
        First Release >>> 13 math functions included:
            1)  "htam.floor"        >>>   floor
            2)  "htam.ceil"         >>>   ceiling
            3)  "htam.frac"         >>>   fractional part
            4)  "htam.root"         >>>   nth root of a number
            5)  "htam.mod"          >>>   linear congruence solver
            6)  "htam.gcd"          >>>   greatest common divisor
            7)  "htam.lcm"          >>>   least common multiple
            8)  "htam.div"          >>>   divisors of a number
            9)  "htam.prime"        >>>   nth prime number
            10) "htam.pi"           >>>   number of primes less than a given number (pi function)
            11) "htam.primefac"     >>>   prime factorization of a number
            12) "htam.fac"          >>>   factorial of a number
            13) "htam.col"          >>>   collatz conjecture checker
