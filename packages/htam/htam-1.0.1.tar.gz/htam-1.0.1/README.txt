This is my first package and it includes a lot of cool math functions.

I created it because I like maths and to test my python skills.

- Run htam.info() to see general informations about htam and all functions included
- Run htam.info(function_name) to see detailed informations about that function

If you run into any issue, please send me an email and i will update the package as soon as I can.

I'm still working to improve this package, so, if you have any idea for a future update or a re-styling of an already existing function, please let me know with an email, I would really appreciate it.

Enjoy :)



- Current htam version: 

1.0.1
