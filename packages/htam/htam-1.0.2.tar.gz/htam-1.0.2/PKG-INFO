Description: This is my first package and it includes a lot of cool math functions.
        
        I created it because I like maths and to test my python skills.
        
        - Run htam.info() to see general informations about htam and all functions included
        - Run htam.info(function_name) to see detailed informations about that function
        
        If you run into any issue, please send me an email and i will update the package as soon as I can.
        
        I'm still working to improve this package, so, if you have any idea for a future update or a re-styling of an already existing function, please let me know with an email, I would really appreciate it.
