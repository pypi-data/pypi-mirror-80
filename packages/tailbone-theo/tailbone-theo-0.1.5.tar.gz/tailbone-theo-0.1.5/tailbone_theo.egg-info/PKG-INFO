        =============
        
        This is an experimental project, as of this writing.  Its purpose is 2-fold:
        
        * hopefully provide a useful app for managing special/case orders for customers
        * either way, hopefully provide a good working example of the code
        
        This may also attempt certain aspects of "curbside" and/or "delivery" orders at
        some point, we'll see.  Nobody should be holding their breath maybe.
        
        See the `Rattail Project`_ for more info.
