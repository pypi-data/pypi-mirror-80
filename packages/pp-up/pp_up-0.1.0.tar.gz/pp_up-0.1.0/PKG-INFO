Description: pp-up
        =====
        
        Overview
        --------
        Script to update your dependencies by checking if there are new versions
        available on pypi.
        
        This script parses your requirements.txt and setup.py files, and updates any
        pinned version you may have to the latest version available on pypi.
        
        When you have a version pinned for a specific reason add `# pp_up: pin` to the line you want
        to pin, this only works on requirements files example:
        
        ```
        pp_up==0.0.1 # pp_up: pin
        ```
        
        The files are backupped before modification.
        
        Usage
        -----
        ```bash
        cd $YOUR_PROJECT_DIR
        python -m pp_up
        ```
