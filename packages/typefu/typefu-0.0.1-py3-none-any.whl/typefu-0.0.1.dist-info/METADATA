# typefu

An utility to help you map data types between different data sources and data files.
Originally created to find mappings between `Microsoft SQL Server` and `Apache Spark` but expanded to `avro` and `parquet`.

Idea is to consolidate also schemas for `PyArrow`.

Early development. Use with caution.
