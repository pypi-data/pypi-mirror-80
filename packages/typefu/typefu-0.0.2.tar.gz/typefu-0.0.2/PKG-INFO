Description: # typefu
        
        An utility to help you map data types between different data sources and data files.
        Originally created to find mappings between `Microsoft SQL Server` and `Apache Spark` but expanded to `avro` and `parquet`.
        
        Idea is to consolidate also schemas for `PyArrow`.
        
        Early development. Use with caution.
