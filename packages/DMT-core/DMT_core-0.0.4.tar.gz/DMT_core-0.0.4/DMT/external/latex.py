    full_path_to_file : str or os.Pathlike
    additional_compiler: (str , [str])
        If a additional tex compiler should be used, supply it here. It will be tried as first compiler.
        The additional compiler must be given in this argument with (<call_of_compiler>, List of compiler arguments).
        For example 'latexmk' looks like: ('latexmk', ['--interaction=nonstopmode', '--shell-escape', '--pdf'])
    wait : Boolean, False
        Wait for the build to complete.
