class Singleton(type):
    """ Implements the Singleton design pattern. Classes that use this class as a metaclass can only be initiated once.

    If a new object of a singleton class is instanciated, the already existing one is returned.
    But the added implementation here, tries to transfer the given kwargs to the old object.
