# retro-unu is a tool for extracting code from literate sources. It
# will write output to stdout.
#
# it has been enhaced to convert literate sources to valid reStructedText
# with the source defined by code blocks.  It can also reverse the process.
#
# PS. The conversion to .rst is lossly and reformats comments
#
# A code block starts with ~~~ on a line by itself and ends with a # second ~~~.
