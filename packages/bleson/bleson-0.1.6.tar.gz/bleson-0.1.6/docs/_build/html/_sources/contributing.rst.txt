Contributing
************

Contributions to the library are welcome! Here are some guidelines to follow.

Suggestions
===========

Please make suggestions for additional components or enhancements to the
codebase by opening an `issue`_ explaining your reasoning clearly.

Bugs
====

Please submit bug reports by opening an `issue`_ explaining the problem clearly
using code examples.

Documentation
=============

The documentation source lives in the `docs`_ folder. Contributions to the
documentation are welcome but should be easy to read and understand.

Commit messages and pull requests
=================================

Commit messages should be concise but descriptive, and in the form of a patch
description, i.e. instructional not past tense ("Add beacon example" not "Added
beacon example").

Commits which close (or intend to close) an issue should include the phrase
"fix #123" or "close #123" where ``#123`` is the issue number, as well as
include a short description, for example: "Add beacon example, close #123", and
pull requests should aim to match or closely match the corresponding issue
title.

Backwards compatibility
=======================

Not particularly releveant yet, but one aspiration is to keep the public API as unchanged as possible in the alpha and beta phases.

Python 2/3
==========

The library is only compatible with Python 3.
