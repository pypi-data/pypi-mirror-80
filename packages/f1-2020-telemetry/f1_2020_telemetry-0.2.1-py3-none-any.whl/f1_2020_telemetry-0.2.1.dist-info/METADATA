F1 2020 UDP Telemetry package
=============================

The f1-2020-telemetry package provides support for interpreting telemetry information as sent out over the network by [the F1 2020 game by CodeMasters](https://www.codemasters.com/game/f1-2020/).
It also provides command-line tools to record, playback, and monitor F1 2020 session data.

With each yearly release of the F1 series game, CodeMasters post a description of the corresponding telemetry packet format on their forum.
For F1 2020, the packet format is described here: https://forums.codemasters.com/topic/50942-f1-2020-udp-specification/

The package should work on Python 3.6 and above.

This project is a fork of f1-2019-telemetry by Sidney Cadot (reddish) for F1 2019
