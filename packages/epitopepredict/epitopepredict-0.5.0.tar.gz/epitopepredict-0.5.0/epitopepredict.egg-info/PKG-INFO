Description: Background
        ----------
        
        epitopepredict provides a standardized programmatic interface and command line tool for
        executing multiple epitope prediction methods. Currently this largely consists of interfaces
        to several MHC binding prediction, the results of which can then be processed and visualized
        in a consistent manner. The Tepitope module implements the TEPITOPEPan method is provided as
        a 'built in' method. The IEDB tools and netMHCIIpan and mhcflurry are also supported.
        All of these tools are free for academic use. This software runs on most linux systems.
        Users are recommended to use the snap package for convenience. This software is under
        active development particularly with a view to improve the command line and web tools.
