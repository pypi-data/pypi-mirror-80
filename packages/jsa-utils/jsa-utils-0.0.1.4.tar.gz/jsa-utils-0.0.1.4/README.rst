====================================
JetStream Utilities
====================================

JSA Utilities is a python package built
for the purpose of maintaining common
reusable functions across all JetStream's
micro services.


**`assets.py`** - houses independent reusable functions across micro-services

**`settings.py`** - abstracts all the common settings configuration we have on all micro-services fetching from .env file or environment variables
