This Python module wraps the "libgettextpo" library that is part of
the GNU gettext package.

The "libgettextpo" library from GNU gettext is licensed under the GNU
GPL v3 or later as of October 2007 (before that it was GPL v2 or
later) [1].  Therefore, any code using this module must be under a license
compatible with the GPL v2, v3, or any later version.

See also http://code.google.com/p/pygettextpo/, which is probably a
duplicate project, though it has not had a public release yet (as of
26 May 2009).
