    "# Creating a 2-qubit model with a custom 2-qubit gate\n",
    "While pyGSTi is able to support several common types of 2-qubit gates, the space of all possible 2-qubit gates is so large that some users will need to construct their own particular 2-qubit gate \"from scratch\".  In this example, we look at how to construct a 2-qubit model manually.  We'll use `pygsti.construction.build_explicit_model` to construct the single-qubit gates and we'll create a \"non-standard\" 2-qubit gate by specifying the unitary operation it performs as a $4\\times 4$ matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform GST on such a model, one may need to compute new sets of fiducials and/or germ sequences.  Once these are obtained, 2-qubit GST can be run just as in the example which uses one of pyGSTi's built-in 2Q models."

The germs should be computed, though typically you can get away with just using the germ set of a standard model and replacing it's 2-qubit gate with the custom one - so it can be worth checking whether such a set is complete before running a full germ-selection procedure.
