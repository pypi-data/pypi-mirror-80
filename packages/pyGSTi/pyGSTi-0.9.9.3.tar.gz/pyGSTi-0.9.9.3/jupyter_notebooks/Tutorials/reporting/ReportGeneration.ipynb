    "# Report Generation Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi is able to construct polished report documents, which provide high-level summaries as well as detailed analyses of results (Gate Set Tomography (GST) and model-testing results in particular).  Reports are intended to be quick and easy way of analyzing `Model`-type estimates, and pyGSTi's report generation functions are specifically designed to interact with the `ModelEstimateResults` object (producted by several high-level algorithm functions - see, for example, the [GST overview tutorial](../algorithms/GST-Overview.ipynb) and [GST functions tutorial](../algorithms/GST-Drivers.ipynb).).  The report generation functions in pyGSTi takes one or more results (often `ModelEstimateResults`-type) objects as input and produces an HTML file as output.  The HTML format allows the reports to include **interactive plots** and **switches** (see the [workspace switchboard tutorial](advanced/WorkspaceSwitchboards.ipynb), making it easy to compare different types of analysis or data sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi's reports are stand-alone HTML documents which cannot run Python.  Thus, all the results displayed in a report must be pre-computed (in Python).  If you find yourself wanting to fiddle with things and feel that these reports are too static, please consider using a `Workspace` object (see the [Workspace tutorial](Workspace.ipynb)) within a Jupyter notebook, where you can intermix report tables/plots and Python.  Internally, functions like `construct_standard_report` (see below) are simple factories for `Report` objects, which are in turn little more than a wrapper around a `Workspace` object and a set of instructions for how to generate reports of different output formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get some `ModelEstimateResults`\n",
    "We start by performing GST using `do_long_sequence_gst`, as usual, to create a `ModelEstimateResults` object (we could also have just loaded one from file).  See the [GST functions tutorial](../algorithms/GST-Driverfunctions.ipynb) for more details."

    "1. The **HTML reports are the primary report type in pyGSTi**, and are much more flexible.  The PDF reports are more limited (they can only display a *single* estimate and gauge optimization), and essentially contain a subset of the information and descriptive text of a HTML report.  So, if you can, use the HTML reports.  The PDF report's strength is its portability: PDFs are easily displayed by many devices, and they embed all that they need neatly into a single file.  **If you need to generate a PDF report** from `Results` objects that have multiple estimates and/or gauge optimizations, consider using the `Results` object's `view` method to single out the estimate and gauge optimization you're after.\n",
    "2. It's best to use **Firefox** when opening the HTML reports. (If there's a problem with your brower's capabilities it will be shown on the screen when you try to load the report.)\n",
