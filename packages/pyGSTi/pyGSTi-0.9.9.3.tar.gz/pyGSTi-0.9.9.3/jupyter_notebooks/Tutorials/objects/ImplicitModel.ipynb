    "# Implicit Models\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to create and use the implicit-layer-operation models present in pyGSTi.  It *doesn't* show you how to build your own model, which will be the topic of a future tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Implicit models\", as we'll refer to implicit-layer-operation models from now on, store building blocks needed to construct layer operations but not usually the layer operations themselves.  When simulating a circuit, an implicit model creates on the fly, from its building blocks, an operator for each circuit layer in turn.  It therefore only creates operators for the layers that are actually needed for the circuit simulation.  Thus simulating a circuit with an implicit model is similar to building an *explicit* model with just the needed layer-operations based on some **building blocks** and some **rules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit models are very useful within multi-qubit contexts, where there are so many possible circuit layers one cannot easily create and store separate operators for every possible layer.  It is much more convenient to instead specify a smaller set of building-block-operators and rules for combining them into full $n$-qubit layer operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi currently contains two types of implicit models, both derived from `ImplicitOpModel` (which is derived from `Model`):\n",
    "- `LocalNoiseModel` objects are noise models where \"noise\" (the departure or deviance from perfection) of a given gate is localized to *only* the qubits where that gate is intended to act.  Said another way, the key assumption of a `LocalNoiseModel` is that gates act as the perfect identity everywhere except on their *target qubits* - the qubits they are supposed to act nontrivially upon.  Because errors on non-target qubits can broadly be interpreted as \"crosstalk\", we can think of a `LocalNoiseModel` as a *crosstalk-free* model.  For concreteness, some examples of local noise are:\n",
    "    - a rotation gate over-rotates that qubit it's *supposed* to rotate\n",
    "    - a controlled-not gate acts imperfectly on its control and target qubits but *perfectly* on all other qubits\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- `CloudNoiseModel` objects allow imperfections in a gate to involve qubits in a *neighborhood* of or *cloud* around  the gate's target qubits. When the neighborhood is shrunk to just the target qubits themselves this reduced to a local noise model.  What exactly constitutes a neighborhood or cloud is based on a number of \"hops\" (edge-traversals) on a graph of qubit connectivity that is supplied by the user.\n",

    "### Inside an implicit model: `.prep_blks`, `.povm_blks`, `.operation_blks`, and `.instrument_blks`\n",

    "Whereas an `ExplicitModel` contains the dictionaries `.preps`, `.povms`, `.operations`, and `.instruments` (which hold *layer* operators), an `ImplicitModel` contains the dictionaries `.prep_blks`, `.povm_blks`, `.operation_blks`, and `.instrument_blks`.  Each of these dictionaries contains a second level dictionaries, and it is this second level which hold actual operators (`LinearOperator`- and `SPAMVec`-derived objects) - the **building blocks** of the model.  The keys of the top-level dictionary are *category* names, and the keys of the second-level dictionaries are typically gate names or circuit layer labels.  For example, a `LocalNoiseModel` has two categories within its `.operation_blks`: `\"gates\"`, and `\"layers\"`, which we'll see more of below.  \n",

Currently, the preparation and measurement portions of both a `LocalNoiseModel` and a `CloudNoiseModel` are not divided into components (e.g. 1-qubit factors) and so `.prep_blks[\"layers\"]` and `.povm_blks[\"layers\"]` behave similarly to an `ExplicitOpModel`'s `.preps` and `.povms` dictionaries.  Because there's nothing special going on here, we'll omit printing `.prep_blks` and `.povm_blks` for the rest of this tutorial by leaving the default `showSPAM=False` in future calls to `print_implicit_model_blocks`. \n",
    "\n",

The answer is *for efficiency* - it takes some nontrivial amount of work to \"embed\" a 1- or 2-qubit process matrix within a larger (e.g. 4-qubit) process matrix, and we perform this work once up front so it doesn't need to be repeated later on.\n",

Technically, this means that these layer operations contain a *reference* to (not a *copy* of) the `.operation_blks[\"gates\"][\"Gxpi\"]` object.

    "<font style=\"color:red\">Note: cloud-noise models are an advanced feature in pyGSTi, and as such this portion of the tutorial is less complete and more confusing than our tutorials on other topics</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "`CloudNnoiseModel` objects are designed to represent gates whose imperfections affect only the qubits in a neighborhood, or *cloud*, around a gate's target qubits.  This notion of a gate's cloud is fairly flexible, but typically defined as the set of qubits that can be reached by some number ($k$, say) of edge traversals (or *hops*) from the gate's target qubits along a globally given connectivity graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the graph specifies four qubits in a line: $0-1-2-3$ and we allow at most 1 hop along the graph, then the noise cloud of a single-qubit gate on qubit $1$ is the set of qubits $\\{0,1,2\\}$ and the cloud for a two-qubit gate on qubits $1$ and $2$ is the set $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `CloudNoiseModel` also contains a single (noisy) \"global\" or \"background\" idle operation that is intended to specify noise that affects all the qubits during the time of a circuit layer regardless of whether they participate in any gates.  This noisy idle operation (acting on all the qubits) and the noise on each gate (acting on the gate's *cloud*) is taken to have the form $\\exp{\\mathcal{L}}$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is a Lindbladian which contains error terms only up to some *maximum weight* (typically 1 or 2, so we call this a \"low weight\" approximation or constraint).  Thus, **a `CloudNoiseModel` describes noise that is *geometrically-local* and *low-weight*** but not strictly local (i.e. crosstalk-free) as a `LocalNoiseModel` does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each circuit layer is modeled as the global idle composed with gate operation(s) corresponding to that gate(s) in the layer.  Thus, the noise from the global idle and from the gate cloud(s) must be combined when constructing a layer operation.  By default this is done by simply composing the different error maps.  The `errcomp_type` argument, however, can change this behavior so that the Lindbladian *error generators* are composed instead of the maps.  When `errcomp_type=\"gates\"` the noise maps for the components are of a gate layer are composed; when `errcomp_type=\"errorgens\"` the error generators of the noise maps are added and used as the error generator for the final operation (<font style=\"color:red\">this is an advanced topic which isn't covered in this tutorial yet</font>). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a `CloudNnoiseModel` using the `build_standard_cloudnoise_model` function which resembles `build_standard_localnoise_model` but contains some extra arguments dealing with cloud construction and the maximum error weights used:\n",
    "- `maxhops` specifies how many hops from a gate's target qubits (along the qubit graph given by the `geometry` argument ,which defaults to `\"line\"`) describe which qubits comprise the gate's *cloud*.\n",
    "- `maxIdleWeight` specifies the maximum-weight of error terms in the global idle operation.\n",
    "- `maxSpamWeight` specifies the maximum-weight of error terms in the state preparation and measurement operations.\n",
    "- `extraGateWeight` specifies the maximum-weight of error terms in gates' clouds *relative* to the number of target qubits of the gate.  For instance, if `extraGateWeight=0` then 1-qubit gates can have up to weight-1 error terms in their clouds and 2-qubit gates can have up to weight-2 error terms.  If `extraGateWeight=1` then this changes to weight-2 errors for 1Q gates and weight-3 errors for 2Q gates.\n",
    "- `extraWeight1Hops` specifies an additional number of hops (added to `maxhops`) that applies only to weight-1 error terms.  For example, in a 8-qubit line example, if `maxhops=1`, `extraGateWeight=0`, and `extraWeight1Hops=1` then a 2-qubit gate on qubits $4$ and $5$ can have up-to-weight-2 errors on qubits $\\{3,4,5,6\\}$ and additionally weight-1 errors on qubits $2$ and $7$.\n",
    "- `errcomp_type` specifes how errors are composed when creating layer operations.  An advanced topic that we don't explore here.\n",

The construction routines we've seen so far construct models with perfect gates.  The `build_cloud_crosstalk_model` function constructs a *noisy* `CloudNoiseModel` whose noise can be described in a (relatively) simple way via a dictionary of errors.  The `error_rates` argument is a dictionary whose values are themselves dictionaries of error-generator rates (similar to what is allowed in crosstalk-free model construction) and whose keys describe which gate the noise is applied to and upon which qubits the noise is \"centered\".\n",
