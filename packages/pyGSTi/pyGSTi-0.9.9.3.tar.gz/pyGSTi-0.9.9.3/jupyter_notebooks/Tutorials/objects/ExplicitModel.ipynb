    "# Explicit Models Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to create and use `ExplicitOpModel` objects.  `Model` objects are fundamental to pyGSTi, as each represents a set of quantum gates along with state preparation and measurement (i.e. POVM) operations.  In pyGSTi, a \"state space\" refers to a Hilbert space of *pure* quantum states (often thought of as length-$d$ vectors, where $d=2^N$ for $N$ qubits). A \"density matrix space\" refers to a Hilbert space of density matrices, which while often thought of as $d \\times d$ matrices can also be represented by length $d^2$ vectors.  Mathematically, these vectors live in Hilbert-Schmidt space, the space of linear operators on the original $d\\times d$ density matrix space.  pyGSTi uses the \"Liouville\" vector-representation for density matrices and POVM effects, since this allows quantum gates to be represented by $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrices which act on Hilbert-Schmidt vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ExplicitOpModel` objects are the simplest type of `Model` objects in pyGSTi.  They have the look and feel of Python dictionaries which hold $d^2\\times d^2$ operation matrices, length-$d^2$ state preparation vectors, and sets of length-$d^2$ effect vectors which encode positive operator value measures (POVMs).  State preparation and POVM effect vectors are both generically referred to as \"SPAM\" (state preparation and measurement) vectors. "

    "## Creating models\n",
    "Before getting to `ExplicitOpModels` in particular, lets explain two quantites that *all* `Model` objects posess: a *basis* and *state space labels*:\n",
    "- A model's `.state_space_labels` member (a `StateSpaceLabels` object) describes the model's state space as the direct sum and tensor product of labelled *factors*.  Typically, this is just a tensor product of one or more 2-dimensional qubit spaces labelled by the integers 0 to $N_{qubits}-1$ or `\"Q0\"`, `\"Q1\"`, etc.  We specify a 1-qubit state space using `[\"Q0\"]` below (the \"Q\" tells pyGSTi it's a 2-dimensional *qubit* space).  If you had two qubits you could use `[\"Q0\",\"Q1\"]` or `[0,1]` to describe the tensor product of two qubit spaces, as pyGSTi assumes integer labels stand for qubit spaces too.  To learn more about the `StateSpaceLabels` object, see the [state space labelling tutorial](advanced/StateSpaceLabels.ipynb).\n",
    "- A model's `.basis` member (a `Basis` object) describes how any dense representations (matrices or vectors) of the the operations in a `Model` should be interpreted.  We'll be using the \"Pauli product\" basis, which is named `\"pp\"` in pyGSTi and consists of the tensor products of Pauli matrices (since our example has just a 1-qubit state space the `\"pp\"` basis is just the 4 Pauli matrices $\\{\\sigma_0,\\sigma_X,\\sigma_Y,\\sigma_Z\\}$).  To learn more about `Basis` objects see the [Basis object tutorial](advanced/MatrixBases.ipynb)).\n",

    "### Creating a `ExplicitOpModel` from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Layer operations (often called \"gates\" in a 1- or even 2-qubit context) and SPAM vectors can be assigned to a `ExplicitOpModel` object as to an ordinary python dictionary.  Internally a `ExpicitOpModel` holds these quantities as `LinearOperator`- and `SPAMVec`- and `POVM`-derived objects, but you may assign lists, Numpy arrays, or other types of Python iterables to a `ExplicitOpModel` key and a conversion will be performed automatically.  To keep gates, state preparations, and POVMs separate, the `ExplicitOpModel` object looks at the beginning of the dictionary key being assigned: keys beginning with `rho`, `M`, and `G` are categorized as state preparations, POVMs, and gates, respectively.  To avoid ambiguity, each key *must* begin with one of these three prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To separately access (set or get) the state preparations, POVMs, and operations contained in a `ExplicitOpModel` use the `preps`, `povms`, and `operations` members respectively.  Each one provides dictionary-like access to the underlying objects.  For example, `myModel.operations['Gx']` accesses the same underlying `LinearOperator` object as `myModel['Gx']`, and similarly for `myModel.preps['rho0']` and `myModel['rho0']`.  The values of operations and state preparation vectors can be read and written in this way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A POVM object acts similarly to dictionary of `SPAMVec`-derived effect vectors, but typically requires all such vectors to be initialized at once, that is, you cannot assign individual effect vectors to a `POVM`.  The string-valued keys of a `POVM` label the outcome associated with each effect vector, and are therefore termed *effect labels* or *outcome labels*.  The outcome labels also designate data within a `DataSet` object (see the [DataSet tutorial](DataSet.ipynb)), and thereby associate modeled POVMs with experimental measurements. \n",

    "## Explicit Model Parameterizations\n",
    "In addition to specifying a set of $d^2 \\times d^2$ operation matrices and length-$d^2$ SPAM vectors, every `Model` encapsulates a *parametrization*, that is, a function mapping a set of real-valued *parameters* to its set of operation matrices and SPAM vectors.  A `Model`'s contents must always correspond to a valid set of parameters, which can be obtained by its `to_vector` method, and can always be initialized from a vector of parameters via its `from_vector` method.  The number of parameters (obtained via `num_params`) is independent (and need not equal!) the total number of gate-matrix and SPAM-vector elements comprising the `Model`.  For example, in a \"TP-parameterized\" model, the first row of each operation matrix is fixed at `[1,0,...0]`, regardless to what the `Model`'s underlying parameters are.  When pyGSTi generates `Model` estimates the *parameters* of an initial `Model` (often times the \"target\" model) supplied by the caller are optimized.  Thus, by its parameterization a single `Model` can determine the space of possible `Model`s that are searched for a best-fit estimate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each gate and SPAM vector within a `ExplicitOpModel` have independent paramterizations, so that each `pygsti.objects.LinearOperator`-derived gate object and `pygsti.objects.SPAMVec`-derived SPAM vector has its own `to_vector`, `from_vector`, and `num_params` method.  A `Model`'s parameter vector is just the concatenation of the parameter vectors of its contents, in the order: 1) state preparation vectors, 2) measurement vectors, 3) gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users are able to create their own gate parameterizations by deriving from `pygsti.objects.LinearOperator` or `pygsti.objects.DenseOperator` (which itself derives from `LinearOperator`).  Included in pyGSTi are several convenient gate parameterizations which are worth knowing about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `FullDenseOp` class defines a gate which has a parameter for every element, and thus optimizations using this gate class allow the operation matrix to be completely arbitrary.\n",
    "- The `TPDenseOp` class defines a gate whose first row must be `[1,0,...0]`.  This corresponds to a trace-preserving (TP) gate in the Gell-Mann and Pauli-product bases.  Each element in the remaining rows is a separate parameter, similar to a fully parameterized gate.  Optimizations using this gate type are used to constrain the estimated gate to being trace preserving.\n",
