    "Now that we know how to make circuits containing labels with arguments, let's cover how you connect these labels with gate operations.  A gate label without any arguments corresponds to an \"operator\" object in pyGSTi; a label with arguments typically corresponds to an object *factory* object.  A factory, as its name implies, creates operator objects \"on demand\" using a supplied set of arguments which are taken from the label in a circuit.  The main function in an `OpFactory` object is `create_object`, which accepts a tuple of arguments as `args` and is expected to return a gate object.\n",

In this case, our factory generates a X-rotation gate whose rotation angle is given by the one and only argument.  We return this as a `StaticDenseOp` because we're not worrying about how the gate is parameterized for now (parameters are the things that GST twiddles with, and are distinct from arguments, which are fixed by the circuit)."
