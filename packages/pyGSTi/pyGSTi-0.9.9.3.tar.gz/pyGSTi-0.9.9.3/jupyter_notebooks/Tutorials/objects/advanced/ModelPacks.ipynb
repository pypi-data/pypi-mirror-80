    "# Tutorial on pyGSTi \"model packs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi comes shipped with a number of \"model packs\", each of which contains a small (few-qubit) noise model and related information.  This related information is typically *derived* from the base noise model, but it's computation is nontrivial or inconvenient.  The convenience of having meta-data packaged together with the base model is the sole reason for model packs in pyGSTi. \n",

    "Model-packs look like modules and you import them from `pygsti.modelpacks` in the usual way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Model packs are a new addition to pyGSTi.  Previously, \"standard modules\" were used, which served a similar purpose but held models that were less extensible to multi-qubit systems.  If you need to use the old `std`-prefixed modules, they're now located within `pygsti.modelpacks.legacy`.\n",

    "Each model pack defines a 1- or 2-qubit model and number of related quantites.  Sometimes you'll just want to use the `Model`, and importing a standard module is just a convenient way to create a commonly used model for 1 or 2 qubits (the `smq1Q_XYI` module is for the 1-qubit model containing *Idle*, $X(\\pi/2)$ and $Y(\\pi/2)$ gates).  A model pack's model always contains *perfect* (unitary) operations, and is called the *target model* because often times this is the model you wish described your system.  You can get a copy of it by using the `target_model` function:"

    "\n",
    "1. **It's a *copy*.**  If you modify it, it won't change what's stored in the model pack.  This means that you don't need to add a `.copy()` (e.g. `mdl = smq1Q_XYI.target_model().copy()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **It's *fully parameterized*.**  By default, `target_model()` returns a fully-parameterized `Model`, meaning that each of its operations contain an independent parameter for each one of their elements.  If you want a different parameterization, such as a TP-constrained model, you can specify this as an argument:"

    "3. **It has gate names that are tuples of the form (name, *qubits*).**  The gate names (keys of the models `.operations` dictionary) use pyGSTi's multi-qubit labeling convention, e.g. `(\"Gx\",0)`, `(\"Gx\",1)`, or `(\"Gcnot\",0,1)`.  Note that the label for an idle is just an empty tuple, indicating an empty circuit layer.  If you need one of the old standard modules that uses simple strings as gate labels, you'll need to import the `std` analogue from `pygsti.modelpacks.legacy` (e.g. `from pygsti.modelpacks.legacy import std1Q_XYI`)."

    "## Quantities for running GST\n",
    "In addition to a target `Model`, a GST-type model pack (most of them are this type) contains a number of `Circuit` list generating functions used for running Gate Set Tomography (GST).  All of these functions (like `target_model`) take a `qubit_labels` argument that can specify a non-default set of qubit labels to use.  The circuit-list functions include:\n",
    "- preparation fiducials: `prep_fiducials`\n",
    "- measurement (effect) fiducials: `meas_fiducials`\n",
    "- germ sequences: `germs`\n",
    " - this function has an additional `lite` argument that, when True (the default) gives a shorter list of germ circuits that amplify all the errors in the target model to *first order*.  This is usually all that is needed to achieve the high-accuracy typically desired from GST results, and so we recommend starting with this list of germs since it's shorter.  When `lite=False` a longer list of germ circuits is returned that amplify all the errors in the target model to *higher orders*.  Although typically unnecessary, this \"paranoid\" set of germs can be particularly helpful when you expect and don't care about some departures (errors) from the target model.\n",
    "- fiducial pair reductions (see the [circuit reduction tutorial](../../algorithms/advanced/GST-FiducialPairReduction.ipynb) for more details):\n",
    " - `global_fidPairs` is not a function, but just a list of 2-tuples giving the indices (within `prep_fiducials` and `meas_fiducials`) of the fiducial circuits to keep when implementing global fiducial pair reduction.\n",
    " - `pergerm_fidpair_dict` and `pergerm_fidpair_dict_lite` are dictionaries of lists-of-2-tuples giving the indices of the fiducial circuits to keep on a per-germ basis (dict keys are germ circuits) when implementing per-germ fiducial pair reduction.\n",
