    "The `pygsti` package provides multiple ways to use its core Gate Set Tomography (GST) algorithms.  This  tutorial will show you how to work with pyGSTi's GST protocol objects to perform GST in different ways with a minimial amount of effort.  In order to run the GST protocol there are 3 essential ingredients: 1) an \"experiment design\" specifying the structure of the GST circuits and how the data should be collected, 2) the outcome counts for the circuits specified by the experiment design, and 3) a desired, or \"target\", `Model`.  The [GST overview tutorial](GST-Overview.ipynb), gave an end-to-end example of how to construct a GST experiment design, run GST, and generate a report.  This tutorial focuses on the first and second steps in more detail; related information about circuit construction and report generation can be found in the [GST circuits tutorial](../objects/advanced/GSTCircuitConstruction.ipynb) and [report generation tutorial](../reporting/ReportGeneration.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different `Protocol` objects within pyGSTi for running GST:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`GateSetTomography`](#gatesettomography) - runs a single model optimization based on a *given* initial model that can have any parameterization you like.  This protocol can be run on any `GateSetTomographyDesign` experiment design, which only needs a target model (to describe what gates occur in the circuits) and a list of circuit lists to specify the circuits used for each iteration of the model optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`StandardGST`](#standardgst) - runs multiple model optimizations based on an `ExplicitOpModel` target model by parameterizing this model in different ways.  The target model is expected to be a part of the experiment design, and only `StandardGSTDesign`-type experiment designs are allowed since the usual germs-and-fiducials structure of the GST circuits is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the `GateSetTomography` protocol is more flexible than the `StandardGST` protocol, but requires a little more work to get going because its inputs are more complicated.  Both protocols return a `ModelEstimateResults` object when they are run."

    "## `GateSetTomography`\n",
    "This protocol performs a single model optimization, and so computes a **single GST estimate** given a `DataSet`, a target `Model`, and other parameters.  (The returned `ModelEstimateResults` object may sometimes contain multiple related estimates in certain cases, but in these cases all the estimates are closely related.)  The experiment design provides all of the information about the GST circuits, in this case a *standard*  (*prep_fiducial + germ^power + meas_fiducial*) set, so the only thing needed by the protocol is an initial `Model` to optimize.  Thus, the `GateSetTomography` protocol is essentially just a model optimizer that you give an initial point.  Importantly, this initial point (a `Model`) also specifies the *parameterization*, i.e. the space of parameters that are optimized over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimally, when using `GateSetTomography` you should set the parameterization of the initial model.  This can be viewed as setting the constraints on the optimization.  For instance, when the gates in the model are parameterized as trace-preserving (TP) maps, the optimization will be constrained to trying gate sets with TP gates (because every set of parameters corresponds to a set of TP gates).  In the cell below, we constrain the optimization to TP gate sets by using `.target_model(\"TP\")`, which returns a version of the target model where all the gates are TP-parameterized, the state preparation has trace = 1, and the POVM effects always add to the identity.  This could also be done by calling `set_all_parameterizations(\"TP\")` on the fully-parameterized target model returned by `.target_model()`.  See the [tutorial on explicit models](../objects/ExplicitModel.ipynb) for more information on setting a model's parameterization."

    "### Gauge optimization parameters\n",
    "The `gaugeopt_suite` argument specifies a set of gauge optimizations to be performed on the final GST estimate.  It is a dictionary whose keys are gauge-optimization names (these can be whatever you want) and whose values are dictionaries of arguments ultimately to be passed to the `gaugeopt_to_target` function (which provides full documentation).  (For example, by specifying `itemWeights` we can set the ratio of the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) weighting to the gate weighting when performing a gauge optimization.)  In lieu of a dictionary of `gaugeopt_to_target` arguments, the elements of `gaugeopt_suite` may also be strings which name a built-in set of gauge optimizations (e.g. `\"stdgaugeopt\"` is the name of the standard gauge optimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "If `gaugeopt_suite` is set to a string, this is the same as passing a dictionary with a single key-value pair where both key and value are equal to the string.  Thus, the default `\"stdgaugeopt\"` is equivalent to specifying the dictionary `{\"stdgaugeopt\": \"stdgagueopt\"}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below performs a customized gauge-optimization where the gate parameters are weighted 1000 times more relative to the SPAM parameters.  Mathematically this corresponds to a multiplicative factor of 0.001 preceding the sum-of-squared-difference terms corresponding to SPAM elements in the model.   Typically it is good to weight the gates parameters more heavily since GST amplifies gate parameter errors via long operation sequences but cannot amplify SPAM parameter errors.  For more details on the arguments of `gaugeopt_to_target`, see the previous tutorial on low-level algorithms.  For more infomation, see the [gauge optimization tutorial](advanced/GaugeOpt.ipynb).\n",

A `CircuitStructure` is preferable as it allows the structured plotting of the sequences in report figures.
