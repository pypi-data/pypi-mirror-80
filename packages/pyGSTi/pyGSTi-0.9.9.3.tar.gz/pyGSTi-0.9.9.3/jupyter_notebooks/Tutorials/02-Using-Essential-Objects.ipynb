    "## Computing circuit outcome probabilities\n",
    "One of the simplest uses of pyGSTi is to construct a `Model` and use it to compute the outcome probabilities of one or more `Circuit` objects.  This is generally accomplished using the `.probs` method of a `Model` object as shown below (this was also demonstrated in the [essential objects tutorial](01-EssentialObjects.ipynb)).  The real work  is in constructing the `Circuit` and `Model` objects, which is covered in more detail in the [circuits tutorial](objects/Circuit.ipynb) and in the [explicit-model](objects/ExplicitModel.ipynb) (best for 1-2 qubits) and [implicit-model](objects/ImplicitModel.ipynb) (best for 3+ qubits) tutorials.

This is performed by the `generate_fake_data` function, which just samples the circuit-outcome probability distribution.

    "## Testing how well a model describes a set of data\n",
    "The above section showed how the circuit-outcome probabilities computed by a `Model` object can be used to generate data.  We can also compare these probabilities with the outcome counts in an existing `DataSet`, that is, ask the question: \"For each circuit, how well do the frequencies of the outcomes (in the data) align with the probabilities predicted by the model?\".  There are several common statistics for this purpose; the two used most often in pyGSTi are the $\\chi^2$ and log-likelihood ($\\log\\mathcal{L}$) statistics.  If you're not sure what these are, the Methods section of [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14485) provides some details and here are a few practical considerations:\n",
    "- the larger $\\log\\mathcal{L}$ is, and the smaller $\\chi^2$ is, the better the model agrees with the data.\n",
    "- the value of $\\log\\mathcal{L}$ doesn't mean anything in isolation - only when compared to other $\\log\\mathcal{L}$ values.\n",
    "- one can compute the $\\log\\mathcal{L}$ of a \"maximal model\" that agrees with the data exactly.  We call this value $\\log\\mathcal{L}_{max}$.\n",
    "- in the limit of many samples, $\\chi^2 \\approx 2(\\log\\mathcal{L}_{max}-\\log\\mathcal{L})$, and we denote the latter $2\\Delta\\log\\mathcal{L}$.  \n",
    "- let $k$ be the the number of independent degrees of freedom in the data (e.g. each row of 4 (00, 01, 10, and 11) counts in the example below contributes $3$ degrees of freedom because the counts are constrained to add to 100, so $k=5*3=15$). If the model is \"valid\" (i.e. it *could* have generated the data) then $2\\Delta\\log\\mathcal{L}$ should have come from a $\\chi^2_k$ distribution, i.e. it has expectation value $k$ and standard deviation $\\sqrt{2k}$.\n",

Second, there is [\"Direct RB\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07975), which is particularly suited to multi-qubit benchmarking.  More more details on using these protocols (e.g. how to generate a set of RB sequences) see the separate [Clifford RB tutorial](algorithms/CliffordRB.ipynb) and [Direct RB tutorial](algorithms/DirectRB.ipynb) notebooks.  Below we demonstrate how easy it is to analyze RB data (the same using either protocol).  For further details and options on analyzing RB data, see the [RB data analysis tutorial](algorithms/RBAnalysis.ipynb).  If you're interested using pyGSTi noise models to simulate RB results, see the tutorials for [Clifford RB simulation using explicit-op models](algorithms/advanced/CliffordRB-Simulation-ExplicitModel.ipynb) and [Clifford RB simulation using implicit models](algorithms/advanced/CliffordRB-Simulation-ImplicitModel.ipynb)."

To learn more about how to run GST using functions that act on essential objects see the [function-based GST overview tutorial](algorithms/GST-Overview-functionbased.ipynb) and the [GST driver functions tutorial](algorithms/GST-Driverfunctions.ipynb).  GST can also be run in a more object-oriented way, using `Protocol` objects as described in the [GST overview tutorial](algorithms/GST-Overview.ipynb).\n",

The `ModelEstimateResults` object in pyGSTi is responsible for holding the GST and other model-based protocol results.  The structure and use of a `ModelEstimateResults` object is explained in the [Results tutorial](objects/advanced/Results.ipynb).  A common use for results objects is to generate \"reports\".  PyGSTi has the ability to generate HTML reports (a directory of files) whose goal is to display relevant model vs. data metrics such as $2\\Delta\\log\\mathcal{L}$ as well as model vs. model metrics like process fidelity and diamond distance. To learn more about generating these \"model-explaining\" reports see the [report generation tutorial](reporting/ReportGeneration.ipynb).\n",
