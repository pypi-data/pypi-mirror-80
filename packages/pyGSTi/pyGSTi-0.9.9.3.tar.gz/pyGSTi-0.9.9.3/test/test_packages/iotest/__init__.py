        This is distinct from the contexts provided by tempfile in

        underlying file may be opened or closed inside the context as
        the caller pleases.

        Under the hood, this actually creates the file in a temporary
        directory. This directory will be cleaned up when the context
        closes, including the returned file and any other siblings.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename: str, optional
            Optionally, the name of the file. By default, one will be
            randomly generated.

        Yields
        ------
        str
            The path of the temporary file.
