Description: # FoodVisor Challenge 1
        
        FoodNetx is a library created using the python package *NetworkX*. It creates a database based in graphs, in concrete a Directed graph, in which could occur cycles. The main idea is cover the challenge of Foodvisor ( [Challenge1](https://github.com/Foodvisor/coding-assignment) and [Challenge2](https://github.com/Foodvisor/home-assignment) ) but any other use is welcomed, please if it used reference this Github and its creator.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Source file
        
        1. Download the source file from github
        2. Unzip and navigate to the folder containing `setup.py` and other files
        3. Run the following command: `python setup.py install`
        
        ### Pip
        
        ```python3
            pip3 install FoodNetX
        ```
        
        ## Testing and replicating the results for the Foodvisor challenges
        
        Download and install the python package *FoodNetx*, then clone the repo.
        In the Github repository has been left a folder called *Test*, where tests are stored.
        To execute any test, just use the following shell command from inside the github repo:
        
        ```shell
        python3 ./Test/TestFile.py
        ```
        
        Example:
        
        ```bash
        python3 ./Test/FoodVisor_Challenge1_test.py
        ```
        
        If you use an IDE for programming just select the test file desired and just click Run.
        
        ### Test's outputs
        
        **FoodVisor_Challenge1_test.py**: 
        
        ```python
        {"img001": "granularity_staged", "img002": "valid"}
        {"img001": "granularity_staged", "img002": "coverage_staged", "img003": "invalid"}
        ```
        
        
        
        ##  New modules in development  
        
        By now the foodvisor challenge #2 is being developed and implemented to join this package at the end of this week
        
        ## Python Compatibility
        
        * [Python](http://www.python.com) - v3.7
        
        ### Note
        
        This library has been created with the help of [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/mat) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
