granules from EARS.

supervisord.conf
----------------

Configuration file for Supervisord, which starts all the processing steps.

trollstalker.ini and trollstalker_logging.ini
---------------------------------------------

Configuration file for Trollstalker, which creates posttroll messages
for incoming files, and logging config for it.

segment_gatherer.ini
--------------------

Configuration file for segment_gatherer, which collects the messages
coming from trollstalker to one message that contains metadata of all
the required files for one time step.  That is, it collects M and DNB
channels together.  If DNB channel is not available (like during the
day), collection times out and sends only the M channel in the
dataset.

gatherer_ears_viirs.ini
-----------------------

Configuration file for gatherer.py, which collects the granules to cover
one or more areas of interest.  The collected metadata are then sent and
received by trollflow2.

Definition of the products to be generated: composites, target areas,
file formats, filename patterns.
