This is a Pytorch version of scArches  which can be found `here <https://github.com/theislab/scArches/>`_. scArches is a package to integrate newly produced single-cell datasets into integrated reference atlases. Our method can facilitate large collaborative projects with decentralise training and integration of multiple datasets by different groups. scArches is compatible with `scanpy <https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, and hosts efficient implementations of all conditional generative models for single-cell data.

What can you do with scArches?
-------------------------------
- Integrate many single-cell datasets and share the trained model and the data (if possible).
- Download a pre-trained model for your atlas of interest, update it with new datasets and share with your collaborators.
- Construct a customized reference by downloading a reference atlas, add a few  pre-trained adaptors (datasets) and project your own data in to this customized reference atlas.
- Project and integrate query datasets on the top of a reference and use latent representation for downstream tasks, e.g.: diff testing, clustering.

Usage and installation
-------------------------------
See `here <https://scarchesp.readthedocs.io/>`_ for documentation and tutorials.

Support and contribute
-------------------------------
If you have a question or new architecture or a model that could be integrated into our pipeline, you can
post an `issue <https://github.com/theislab/scarchesp/issues/new>`__ or reach us by `email <mailto:cottoneyejoe.server@gmail.com,mo.lotfollahi@gmail.com,mohsen.naghipourfar@gmail.com>`_. Our package supports tf/keras now but pytorch version will be added very soon.
