Description: # Queueing Recurrent Neural Network (Q-RNN) [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
        
        **Queueing Recurrent Neural Network (Q-RNN)** is a new kind of Artificial Neural Network that has been designed to use in time-series forecasting applications. According to experiments that have been run, QRNN mostly outperforms the LSTM, Simple RNN and GRU, in the cases where the dataset has highly non-linear characteristics.
