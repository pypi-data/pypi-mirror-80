def math(data, operator=None, operator_name=None, axis=None):
    """Apply mathematical operation to each trial and channel individually.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : instance of DataTime, DataFreq, or DataTimeFreq

    operator : function or tuple of functions, optional
        function(s) to run on the data.
    operator_name : str or tuple of str, optional
        name of the function(s) to run on the data.
    axis : str, optional
        for functions that accept it, which axis you should run it on.

    Returns
    -------
    instance of Data
        data where the trials underwent operator.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If you pass both operator and operator_name.
    ValueError
        When you try to operate on an axis that has already been removed.

    Notes
    -----
    operator and operator_name are mutually exclusive. operator_name is given
    as shortcut for most common operations.

    If a function accepts an 'axis' argument, you need to pass 'axis' to the
    constructor. In this way, it'll apply the function to the correct
    dimension.

    The possible point-wise operator_name are:
    'absolute', 'angle', 'dB' (=10 * log10), 'exp', 'log', 'sqrt', 'square',
    'unwrap'

    The operator_name's that need an axis, but do not remove it:
    'hilbert', 'diff', 'detrend'

    The operator_name's that need an axis and remove it:
    'mean', 'gmean' (geometric mean), 'median', 'mode', 'std'

    Examples
    --------
    You can pass a single value or a tuple. The order starts from left to
    right, so abs of the hilbert transform, should be:

    >>> rms = math(data, operator_name=('hilbert', 'abs'), axis='time')

    If you want to pass the power of three, use lambda (or partial):

    >>> p3 = lambda x: power(x, 3)
    >>> data_p3 = math(data, operator=p3)

    Note that lambdas are fine with point-wise operation, but if you want them
    to operate on axis, you need to pass ''axis'' as well, so that:

    >>> std_ddof = lambda x, axis: std(x, axis, ddof=1)
    >>> data_std = math(data, operator=std_ddof)

    If you don't pass 'axis' in lambda, it'll never know on which axis the
    function should be applied and you'll get unpredictable results.

    If you want to pass a function that operates on an axis and removes it (for
    example, if you want the max value over time), you need to add an argument
    in your function called ''keepdims'' (the values won't be used):

    >>> def func(x, axis, keepdims=None):
    >>>     return nanmax(x, axis=axis)
