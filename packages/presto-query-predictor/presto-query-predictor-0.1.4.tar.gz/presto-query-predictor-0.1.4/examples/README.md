# Examples

This folder contains some examples to use the `presto-query-predictor` package.

Make sure you have installed all necessary dependencies, and then

```bash
    cd examples
    python3 load_data.py
    python3 transform.py
    python3 train.py
    python3 tune.py
    python3 app.py
```

Note that the `app.py` cannot be execute correctly without trained models stored
in the current directory. The CPU and memory models can be generated by running
the `train.py` script.
