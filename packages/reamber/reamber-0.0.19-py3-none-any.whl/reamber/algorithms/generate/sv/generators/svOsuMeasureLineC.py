    """ Generates Measure Line movement for osu! maps. Version 3. Inspired by datoujia

    This algorithm is largely similar to Algo B, but I added a collapsing feature.

    This is a separate algorithm to make the distinction clearer, and I believe Algo B may be useful
    in certain places as Algo C can cause flickering on collapse.

    This one directly returns svs and bpms due to the nature of the algorithm requiring osu! objects.

    This could output as Quaver but it has negative scroll
