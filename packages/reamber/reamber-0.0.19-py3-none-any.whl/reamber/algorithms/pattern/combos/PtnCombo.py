        All filters can be found in pattern.filters.PtnFilter. You need to initialize the class with appropriate args

        The filters can be custom made. Here's how to customize your filter if the provided filters do not work well

        Note: The size may change, so the Callable should accommodate if possible.

        **Chord Filter**

        Input: ndarray of ``({size},)``. Where it tells us the length of each chord.

        e.g. [3, 4, 1] means there is a 3, 4, 1 note chord respectively.

        The filter must take that as an argument and return a boolean, whether to INCLUDE the chord sequence or not.

        **Combo Filter**

        Input: ndarray of ``(x, {size})``. Where each row tells us the column

        e.g. [[1, 3, 2], [3, 1, 0]] means there is both a 1 -> 3 -> 2 and 3 -> 1 -> 0 pattern in the sequence.

        The filter must take this and return an ndarray boolean of ``(x,)``.

        Each boolean will tell if the chord should be INCLUDED or not.

        **Type Filter**

        Input: ndarray of ``(x, {size})``. Where each row tells us the type

        e.g. [[Hit, Hold], [Hold, HoldTail]] means there is both a Hit -> Hold and Hold -> HoldTail pattern in the
        sequence.

        The filter must take this and return an ndarray boolean of ``(x,)``.

        Each boolean will tell if the chord should be INCLUDED or not.
