""" This is the part where OJN stores BPM, Notes, Measure Changes and AutoPlays.

For each level (easy, normal, hard), the number of packages are specified.
So we know how many packages we need to loop through

For each package header, it defines the number of events that will occur after it.

By knowing the amount of events and the location of the note, we can find out the offset

Consider this::

            P E P E E E E P E E P E P E E E E E E E E
    Events  1   4         2     1   8
    Snap      1   1 2 3 4   1 2   1   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    Measure 0   1         1     2   2
    Note      ^       ^       ^   ^               ^

From this, we can tell the offset of the notes by calculating the offset from a BPM List and taking a fraction of
the beat by looking at the snap.

Notice that some snaps have no data in them, these are useful to "pad" these notes into place if they have a complex
snap.

There are more specifications on other data decryption in open2jam_.
