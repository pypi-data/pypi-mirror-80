# modelstore

`modelstore` is a Python library that allows you to version, export, and save a machine learning models
to your filesystem or a cloud storage provider (AWS or GCP).

The library's `ModelStore` helps you to (a) version your mdoels, (b) store them in a structured way, and
(c) collect meta data about the Python runtime that was used to train them.

This library has been developed using Python `3.7.0` and is in pre-alpha. Please open an issue if you have
any trouble!

## Installation

```python
pip install modelstore
```

## Usage

```python
from modelstore import ModelStore
#Â And your other imports

# Train your model
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
clf = clf.fit(X, Y)

# Create a model store that uses a Google Cloud bucket (or AWS bucket)
ms = ModelStore.from_gcloud(
   project_name="my-project",
   bucket_name="my-bucket",
)

# Create an archive that exports your model
archive = ms.sklearn.create_archive(model=clf)

# Upload the archive to your model store
meta_data = ms.upload(domain="example-model", archive)

print(json.dumps(meta_data, indent=4))
```
