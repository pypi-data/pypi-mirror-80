Description: # modelstore
        
        `modelstore` is a Python library that allows you to version, export, and save a machine learning models
        to your filesystem or a cloud storage provider (AWS or GCP).
        
        The library's `ModelStore` helps you to (a) version your mdoels, (b) store them in a structured way, and
        (c) collect meta data about the Python runtime that was used to train them.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```python
        pip install modelstore
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        # Train your model
        clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
        clf = clf.fit(X, Y)
        
        # Create a model store that uses a Google Cloud bucket (or AWS bucket)
        ms = ModelStore.from_gcloud(
           project_name="my-project",
           bucket_name="my-bucket",
        )
        
        # Create an archive that exports your model
        archive = ms.sklearn.create_archive(model=clf)
        
        # Upload the archive to your model store
        meta_data = ms.upload(domain="example-model", archive)
        
        print(json.dumps(meta_data, indent=4))
        ```
