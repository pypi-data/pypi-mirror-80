        # Overview
        
        dis·co·set (distributed configurations setup) is a small system that helps you in
        managing your configuration files between various hosts and users. Quite a statement
        for a small script that just calls ln multiple times :-).
        
        The script makes no assumptions about the way you share your configuration files
        between hosts (git, svn, dropbox, ...) or about the layout of your shared folder.
        
        You just describe in a YAML file which configuration files belong to a specific user
        and a specific host and where to put symlinks to them.
        
        See [Discoset_SAMPLE.yml](Discoset_SAMPLE.yml) for an example.
