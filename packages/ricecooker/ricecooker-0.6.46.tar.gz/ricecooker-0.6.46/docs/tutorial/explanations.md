Explanations
============
This page provides more details about the code structure and the metadata needs,
which we glossed over in the [getting started](gettingstarted.html) page.

Feel free to skip these explanations if you're in a hurry, but remember to come
back here and learn the code and metadata technical details, as this knowledge
will be very helpful when you try to create larger, more complicated channels.


How does a chef script work?
----------------------------
Let's look at the chef code we used in the [getting started](gettingstarted.html)
tutorial and walk through and comment on the most important parts of the code.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from ricecooker.chefs import SushiChef
from ricecooker.classes.nodes import TopicNode, DocumentNode
from ricecooker.classes.files import DocumentFile
from ricecooker.classes.licenses import get_license

    channel_info = {                                                         # (2)

        return channel

    """

    simple_chef = SimpleChef()
    simple_chef.main()                                                       # (13)

### Ricecooker Chef API
To use the `ricecooker` library, you create a **sushi chef** scripts that define
a subclass of the base class `ricecooker.chefs.SushiChef`, as shown at (1) in the code.
By extending `SushiChef`, your chef class will inherit all the standard functionality
provided by the `ricecooker` framework.


### Channel metadata
A chef class should have the attribute `channel_info` (dict), which contains the
metadata for the channel, as shows on line (2). Define the `channel_info` as follows:

```python
    channel_info = {
        'CHANNEL_TITLE': 'Channel name shown in UI',
        'CHANNEL_SOURCE_DOMAIN': '<sourcedomain.org>',
        'CHANNEL_SOURCE_ID': '<some unique identifier>',     #
        'CHANNEL_LANGUAGE': 'en',                            # use language codes from le_utils
        'CHANNEL_THUMBNAIL': 'http://yourdomain.org/img/logo.jpg', # (optional) local path or url to a thumbnail image
        'CHANNEL_DESCRIPTION': 'What is this channel about?',      # (optional) longer description of the channel
    }
```
The `CHANNEL_SOURCE_DOMAIN` identifies the domain name of the organization that
produced or is hosting the content (e.g. `khanacademy.org` or `youtube.com`).
The `CHANNEL_SOURCE_ID` must be set to some unique identifier for this channel
within the domain (e.g. `KA-en` for the Khan Academy English channel).
The combination of `CHANNEL_SOURCE_DOMAIN` and `CHANNEL_SOURCE_ID` is used to
compute the `channel_id` for the Kolibri channel you're creating.


### Construct channel
The code responsible for building the structure of the channel your channel by
adding `TopicNode`s, `ContentNodes`s, files, and exercises questions lives here.
This is where most of the work of writing a chef script happens.

You chef class should have a method with the signature:
```python
def construct_channel(self, **kwargs) -> ChannelNode:
    ...
```

To write the `construct_channel` method of your chef class, start by getting the
`ChannelNode` for this channel by calling `self.get_channel(**kwargs)`.
An instance of the `ChannelNode` will be constructed for you, from the metadata
provided in `self.channel_info`. Once you have the `ChannelNode` instance, the
rest of your chef's `construct_channel` method is responsible for constructing
the channel by adding various `Node`s objects to the channel using `add_child`.


### Topic nodes
Topic nodes are folder-like containers that are used to organize the channel's content.
Line (4) shows how to create a `TopicNode` (folder) instance titled "Potatoes!".
Line (5) shows how to add the newly created topic node to the channel.
You can use topic nodes to build arbitrary hierarchies based on subject,
language, grade levels, or any other organizational structure that is best suited
for the specific content source. Reach out to the Learning Equality content team
if you're not sure how to structure your channel. We've got experience with both
technical and curriculum aspects of creating channels and will be able to guide
you to a structure that best first the needs of learners and teachers.


### Content nodes
The `ricecooker` library provides classes like `DocumentNode`, `VideoNode`,
`AudioNode`, etc., to store the metadata associate with content items.
Each content node also has one or more files associated with it,
`EPubFile`, `DocumentFile`, `VideoFile`, `AudioFile`, `ThumbnailFile`, etc.

Line (6) shows how to create a `DocumentNode` to store the metadata for a pdf file.
The `title` and `description` attributes are set. We also set the `source_id`
attribute to a unique identifier for this document. The document does not specify authors,
so we set the `author` attribute to `None`.

On (7), we set `language` attribute to the internal language code `en`, to indicate
the content node is in English. We use the same language code later on line (11)
to indicate the file contents are in English. The Python package `le-utils` defines
the internal language codes used throughout the Kolibri platform (e.g. `en`, `es-MX`, and `zul`).
To find the internal language code for a given language, you can locate it in the
[lookup table](https://github.com/learningequality/le-utils/blob/master/le_utils/resources/languagelookup.json),
or use one of the language lookup helper functions defined in `le_utils.constants.languages`.

Line (8) shows how we set the `license` attribute to the appropriate instance of
`ricecooker.classes.licenses.License`. All non-topic nodes must be assigned a
license upon initialization. You can obtain the appropriate license object using
the helper function `get_license` defined in `ricecooker.classes.licenses`.
Use the predefined license ids given in `le_utils.constants.licenses` as the
first argument to the `get_license` helper function.


### Files
On lines (9, 10, and 11), we create a `DocumentFile` instance and set the appropriate
`path` and `language` attributes. Note that `path` can be either a local filesystem path,
or a web URL (as in the above example). Paths that point to web URLs will be
downloaded automatically when the chef runs and cached locally. Note the default
ricecooker behaviour is to cache downloaded files forever.
Use the `--update` argument to bypass the cached and re-download all files.
The `--update` must be used whenever files are modified but the path stays the same.



### Command line interface
You can run your chef script by passing the appropriate command line arguments:

    ./sushichef.py --token=YOURTOKENHERE9139139f3a23232

The most important argument when running a chef script is `--token` which is used
to pass in the Studio Access Token obtained in Step 1.

To see the full list of `ricecooker` command line options, run `./sushichef.py -h`.
For more details about running chef scripts see the [chefops page](../chefops.md).

<!-- TODOC: link to the steps of the upload process page -->




Deploying the channel
---------------------
At the end of the chef run the complete channel (files and metadata) will be
uploaded to "draft version" of the channel called a "`staging` tree".
The purpose of the staging tree is to allow channel editors can to review the
changes in the "draft version" as compared to the current version of the channel.
Use the **DEPLOY** button in the Studio web interface to activate the "draft copy"
and make it visible to all Studio users. Running the chef script with the `--deploy`
flag will perform this step automatically at the end of the chef run.



Publishing the channel
----------------------
The **PUBLISH** button on Studio is used to save and export a new version of the channel.
The **PUBLISH** action exports all the channel metadata to a sqlite3 DB file served
by Studio at the URL `/content/{{channel_id}}.sqlite3` and ensure the associated
files exist in `/content/storage/` which is served by a CDN.
This step is a prerequisite for getting the channel out of Studio and into Kolibri.
Running the chef scrip with the args `--deploy --publish` will perform both
the **DEPLOY** and **PUBLISH** actions after the chef run completes.
This combination of arguments can be used for testing and debugging, and never
for "production" channels, which should be deployed only after reviewing what changed.
