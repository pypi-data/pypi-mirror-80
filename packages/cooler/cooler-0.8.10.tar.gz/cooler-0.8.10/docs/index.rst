Cooler
======

Cooler is a Python support library for .cool/.mcool files: an efficient storage format for high resolution genomic interaction matrices.

The cooler package aims to facilitate:

* Creation, aggregation and manipulation of genomically-labeled sparse matrices.
* Querying: sequential and range query patterns and tabular and sparse/dense array retrieval.
* Scalable out-of-core operations on the data.
* Data export and visualization.
