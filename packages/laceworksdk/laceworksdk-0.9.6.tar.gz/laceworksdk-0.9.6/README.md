# Lacework Python SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alannix-lw/lacework-python-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alannix-lw/lacework-python-sdk)

**laceworksdk** is a community developed Python library for interacting with the Lacework APIs.

The purpose of this library is to simplify the common tasks required for interacting with the Lacework API, and allow
users write simple code to automate tasks related to their Lacework instance.  From data retrieval to configuration,
this library aims to expose all publicly available APIs.  For example, the following code would authenticate,
fetch events, fetch host vulnerabilities, and fetch container vulnerabilities - in 5 lines of code.

```
from laceworksdk import LaceworkClient

lw = LaceworkClient(api_key="API KEY",
                    api_secret="API SECRET",
                    instance="INSTANCE")

events = lw.events.get_for_date_range(start_time=start_time, end_time=end_time)

host_vulns = lw.vulnerabilities.get_host_vulnerabilities()

container_vulns = lw.vulnerabilities.get_container_vulnerabilities(image_digest="sha256:123")

```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Lacework API Credentials
  - API Key
  - API Secret
  - Instance Name

## How-To

The following data points are required to instantiate a LaceworkClient instance:
   - api_key: The API Key that was generated from the Lacework UI/API.
   - api_secret: The API Secret that was generated from the Lacework UI/API.
   - instance: Your Lacework instance name. (`xxxxx`.lacework.net)

To generate/retrieve an API Key/Secret, do the following:
   - In the Lacework web interface, go to Settings -> API Keys
   - Create a new API Key, or download information for an existing one.

## Installation

Installing and upgrading laceworksdk is easy:

**Install via PIP**

```$ pip install laceworksdk```

**Upgrading to the latest Version**
