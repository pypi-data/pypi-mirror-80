Getting Started
===============

Tutorials are coming soon! Until then, the easiest way to get
started is to look at the example applications in
https://github.com/microspectrometer/dev-kit-2020.

Another good starting point for **writing applications** is to
jump to the :ref:`dev-kit-API-guide`.

If you have the Chromation dev-kit, get a hands-on experience
*without writing any Python* by opening a shell and trying the
:py:mod:`command line utility <bin.microspec_cmdline>`.

Lastly, feel free to contact Chromation directly for help:

* please email sara@chromationspec.com
* tell Sara:

  * what operating system you are using
  * what you'd like help with (e.g., a tutorial to get started, or a specific
    "how do I ...?")
