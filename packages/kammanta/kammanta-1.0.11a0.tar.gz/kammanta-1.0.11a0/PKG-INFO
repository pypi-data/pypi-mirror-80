        # Kammanta
        
        Kammanta is a **productivity** and **life organizing** application inspired by the GTD© methodology,
        and with two attributes that set it apart:
        * Data is **stored as text files and directories** (the actual names of files and dirs are used)
        * The application is ***free software*** (free as in freedom) which means that the source code is
        open, and you can copy and create your own application if you want
        
        ## Installation
        
        The application is developed on Ubuntu. As of now *some features may not work on other major platforms like Windows and MacOS*
        
        ### Using pip
        
        #### Debian-based Linux systems (for example Ubuntu)
        
        `pip3 install kammanta`
        
        This will install the application into the `~/.local/bin` directory
        
        (Detail: The actual files are in `~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages`, `~/.local/bin` only contains the startup script)
        
        Launching the application: ~/.local/bin/kammanta
        
        #### Windows and MacOS
        
        `pip install kammanta`
        
        
        ### Running from source
        
        #### Linux systems
        
        Requirements:
        * Python 3.8
        * PyQt 5.14 (and PyQt5-sip)
        
        `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
        
        Launching the application:
        1. Go to the installation directory in a terminal
        2. `./starts.sh`
        
        
        ## Features
        
        * Data is stored in plain text files, so it's possible to access the files in other ways and on other devices than desktop
          * ex: the user can have a list of errands that she can access on her mobile phone
        * The GUI is updated if files are updated, so that it's possible to work with both the application and  a text editor at the same time
        *

        ## Understanding the application
        
        Definition of "item": _
        
        ### Backend
        
        All data is stored in the file system. Names of dirs and files are used for projects and contacts. Lines in files are used for Next Actions and agenda items
        
        All items can have support material
        
        #### Files and dirs
        
        Some special cases of files:
        * Link files (.desktop for GNU/Linux atm)
        * Text files
          * Note files, used in the inbox (when adding/taking notes)
        * Image - sometimes previews are shown
        
        Support material:
        * If we have a desktop link we can refer to the support material which can then be another file, a directory, etc
        * If the item is another type of file that file itself will be the support material. A typical example is a text file
        * If the item is a directory that directory will contain all the support material
        
        #### Lines (in a text file)
        
        At the end of a line it's possible to have a reference to support material. This is a piece of text that follows the "|" character. It can refer to a website, text file, directory, etc
