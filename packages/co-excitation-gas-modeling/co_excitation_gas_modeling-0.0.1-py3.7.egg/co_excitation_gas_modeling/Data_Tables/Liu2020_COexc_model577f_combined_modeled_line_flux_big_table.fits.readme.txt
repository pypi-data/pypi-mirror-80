Model prediction of CO SLED at z = 4 and with a powerlaw-tail threshold density 10^5 cm^-3. 

Free parameters are:
  mean H2 gas density (lognormal distribution) lg_nH2_mean / cm^-3 : 2.0 to 5.0 in step of 0.25.
  and gas kinetic temperature T_kin / K : [25, 50, 100]. 

CO or [CI] line fluxes are in units of Jy km s^{-1} pc^{-2}. 
  (May or may not have some absolute calibration issue, so please normalize all lines to 
  one CO line before comparing with observations.)

We can use this model grid to compare with observations. 
  We first need to assume a fiducial gas kinetic temperature, 
  e.g., 25 K for main sequence, cold galaxies, 50 K for high redshift dusty galaxies, 
  or even 100 K for extreme galaxies. In comparison with z~6 SMG and QSO CO SLEDs, 
  we find 50 K to be a fair guess. 
  Then, we can normalize all CO line fluxes to one CO line and plot the CO SLED for 
  each lg_nH2_mean. By comparing with observed CO SLED, we can find out which lg_nH2_mean
  best describe the data, which is just the mean gas density of the galaxy under our model
  assumption. 

PS: Our gas density distribution model assumption is following Leroy et al. 2017 (2017ApJ...835..217L).
