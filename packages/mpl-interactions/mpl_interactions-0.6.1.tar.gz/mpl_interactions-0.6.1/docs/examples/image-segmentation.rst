==================
Image Segmentation
==================

Hopefully you won't often be faced with the task of manually segmenting images. However, for the times when you must,
it's nice to not need to leave the comfort of python for some other program. Thus we arrive at the :class:`~mpl_interactions.image_segmenter` class.

(Credit where it's due: This tool was developed as part of a final project in Pavlos Protopapas' class `AC295 <https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2020-AC295/>`_ and you can read more about it
in the project's final write up on `towards data science <https://towardsdatascience.com/how-we-built-an-easy-to-use-image-segmentation-tool-with-transfer-learning-546efb6ae98>`_.)


.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
    import numpy as np
    from mpl_interactions import image_segmenter

    # load a sample image
    with cbook.get_sample_data('ada.png') as image_file:
        image = plt.imread(image_file)
    
    # If you don't keep a reference to the object the call backs will fail
    segmenter = image_segmenter(image, nclasses = 3, mask_colors='red', mask_alpha=.76, figsize=(7,7))
    
    # If working in a Jupyter Notebook
    display(segmenter)

This will create an image in a Matplotlib figure. It will automatically apply 
:meth:`~mpl_interactions.zoom_factory` and :meth:`~mpl_interactions.panhandler`, so now you can: 

* Scroll to zoom 
* Use middle click to pan
* Left click and drag to start creating the mask over the image

.. image:: ../_static/segment.gif

You can switch which class you are marking by directly modifying the ``segmenter``'s ``current_class`` variable:

.. code-block:: python

    segmenter.current_class = 2

And you can always direct the 2D mask with:

.. code-block:: python

    plt.figure()
    plt.imshow(segmenter.mask)


Loading existing masks
----------------------

You can also load an existing mask. You only need to ensure that (1) it does not contain values greater
than nclasses, and (2) that it has the same shape as the image. There are currently no safegaurds for
this, and when there are exceptions in a Matplotlib callback they can be hard to see in the notebook - so be careful!

.. code-block:: python

    # load the mask
    import requests
    import io

    response = requests.get('https://github.com/ianhi/mpl-interactions/raw/41ebd90674e2136e87240ba81ae509dee15a63a7/examples/ada-mask.npy')
    response.raise_for_status()
    mask = np.load(io.BytesIO(response.content))  # Works!

    preloaded = image_segmenter(image, nclasses=3, mask=mask)
    display(preloaded)

.. image:: ../_static/segment-preload-mask.png
