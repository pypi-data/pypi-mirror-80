*reliability* is a Python library for reliability engineering and survival analysis. It significantly extends the functionality of scipy.stats and also includes many specialist tools that are otherwise only available in proprietary software.

## Key features
- Fitting probability distributions to data including right censored data
- Fitting Weibull mixture models
- Calculating the probability of failure for stress-strength interference between any combination of the supported distributions
- Support for Exponential, Weibull, Gamma, Normal, Lognormal, Loglogistic, and Beta probability distributions
- Mean residual life, quantiles, descriptive statistics summaries, random sampling from distributions
- Plots of probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), survival function (SF), hazard function (HF), and cumulative hazard function (CHF)
- Easy creation of distribution objects. Eg. dist = Weibull_Distribution(alpha=4,beta=2)
- Non-parametric estimation of survival function using Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen
- Goodness of fit tests (AICc, BIC, AD)
- Probability plots on probability paper for all supported distributions
- Quantile-Quantile plots and Probability-Probability plots
- Reliability growth, optimal replacement time, sequential sampling charts, similar distributions
- Physics of Failure (SN diagram, stress-strain, fracture mechanics, creep)
- Accelerated Life Testing probability plots (Weibull, Exponential, Normal, Lognormal)
- Accelerated Life Testing Models (Exponential, Eyring, Power, Dual-Exponential, Power-Exponential).
- Mean cumulative function for repairable systems
