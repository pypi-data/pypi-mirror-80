Description: ==========
        pop-create
        ==========
        
        pop-create was originally an internal function of the pop project named
        pop-seed.
        
        pop-create will initialize a new pop project.
        
        
        Geting Started
        ==============
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip3 install pop-create
        
        Now that you have pop-create installed you can run:
        
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pop-create --help
            pop-create poppy
        
        
        This initial release should have identical functionality as `pop-seed` as
        currently provided by the `pop` project.
