==========
pop-create
==========

pop-create was originally an internal function of the pop project named
pop-seed.

pop-create will initialize a new pop project.


Geting Started
==============

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install pop-create

Now that you have pop-create installed you can run:


.. code-block:: bash

    pop-create --help
    pop-create poppy


This initial release should have identical functionality as `pop-seed` as
currently provided by the `pop` project.
