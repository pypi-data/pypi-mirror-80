"""Ladybug Blender Plugin.

Note that this package is not intended to run on its own and it only possesses
the interface between Blender and the Ladybug Tools core libraries as well as
the Blender Sverchok nodes. In order to run the plugin, the core libraries must
be installed in a manner that they can be discovered by Blender.
