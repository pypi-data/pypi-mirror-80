Description: # also_anomaly_detector
        
        Attribute-wise Learning for Scoring Outliers (ALSO) is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm for multidimensional data.
        
        ## Description
        
        Python implementation of ALSO. ALSO, or _Attribute-wise Learning for Scoring Outliers_, is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm for multidimensional data as described in Paulheim, H., Meusel, R. A decomposition of the outlier detection problem into a set of supervised learning problems. Mach Learn 100, 509â€“531 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-015-5507-y
        
        I am not the author, nor in any way affiliated with the authors of the paper above. This is an independent python implementation of the ALSO-approach.
