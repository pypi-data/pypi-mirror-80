Microsoft Azure Machine Learning TensorBoard API for Python
===========================================================

This package has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.6.
=====================================================

The SDK is released with backwards compatibility guarantees.

The Azure Machine Learning *azureml-tensorboard* package combines the AzureML SDK with TensorBoard visualization.

It can be used to:

- Export run history to TensorBoard logs directory. You can run TensorBoard against the directory to view metrics.
- Launch TensorBoard from run history. TensorFlow logs can be written to a specified logs directory and then automatically loaded in real-time from Azure Blob Storage.
