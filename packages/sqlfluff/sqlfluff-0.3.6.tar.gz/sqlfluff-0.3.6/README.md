Bored of not having a good SQL linter that works with whichever dialiect you're
working with? Fluff is an extensible and modular linter designed to help you write
good SQL and catch errors and bad SQL before it hits your database.

> **Sqlfluff** is still in an open alpha phase - expect the tool to change significantly
> over the coming months, and expect potentially non-backward compatable api changes
> to happen at any point. If you'd like to help please consider [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

* **0.1.x** involved a major re-write of the parser, completely changing
  the behaviour of the tool with respect to complex parsing.
* **0.2.x** added templating support and a big restructure of rules
  and changed how users might interact with sqlfluff on templated code.
* **0.3.x** drops support for python 2.7 and 3.4, and also reworks the
  handling of indentation linting in a potentially not backward
  compatable way.

# Getting Started

To get started just install the package, make a sql file and then run sqlfluff and point it at the file.

```shell
$ pip install sqlfluff
$ echo "  SELECT a  +  b FROM tbl;  " > test.sql
$ sqlfluff lint test.sql
== [test.sql] FAIL
L:   1 | P:   1 | L003 | Single indentation uses a number of spaces not a multiple of 4
L:   1 | P:  14 | L006 | Operators should be surrounded by a single space unless at the start/end of a line
L:   1 | P:  27 | L001 | Unnecessary trailing whitespace
```
