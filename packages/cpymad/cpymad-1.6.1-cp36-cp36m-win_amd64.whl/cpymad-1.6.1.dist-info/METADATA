cpymad
------
|Version| |Python| |License| |Gitter| |Tests| |Coverage|

cpymad is a Cython_ binding to MAD-X_ for giving full control and access to a
MAD-X interpreter within the python environment.

This version of cpymad should be built against MAD-X |VERSION|. It can be
installed on linux, Windows and Mac (but I can't offer much help for Mac).
Python 3 is recommended but not (yet) required.

License
~~~~~~~

The cpymad source code itself is under free license.

However, the MAD-X software package and henceforth all binary cpymad package
distributions are **NOT FREE**.

Reporting issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cpymad is NOT maintained by CERN members and links against an unofficial build
of MAD-X that is not supported by CERN, i.e. this binary may have problems
that the official binary does not have and vice versa.

If you have a problem with a sequence file, first try to check if that
problem remains when using the MAD-X command line client distributed by
CERN, then:

- Report the issue to CERN only if it **can** be reproduced with their
  official command line client.
- Report the issue here only if it can **not** be reproduced with their
  official command line client.

For issues regarding the cpymad code itself or usage information, I'm happy to
answer. Please keep it *precise*, *specific*, and *concise* and provide all
the necessary information.
