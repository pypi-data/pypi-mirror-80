Description: pmcyg is a tool for creating an offline Cygwin installer containing customized collections of packages. This avoids having to download the entirety of a Cygwin release, which might occupy many GB, instead allowing installers that can be as small as 40MB. pmcyg enables Cygwin installation from a self-contained CD/DVD image or USB-flash for use on systems without internet access.
