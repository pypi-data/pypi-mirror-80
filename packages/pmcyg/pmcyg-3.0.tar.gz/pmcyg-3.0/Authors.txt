Thanks are also due to the following people who have been
very helpful in testing and improving pmcyg:
    Da-Breegster        (improvements to baseline package lists)
    Michael Hanselmann  (patches to support SHA512 checksums etc.)
    Ken Poole           (testing of utf-8 support)
    John Windle         (use of 'cygcheck' for mirroring existing installation)
