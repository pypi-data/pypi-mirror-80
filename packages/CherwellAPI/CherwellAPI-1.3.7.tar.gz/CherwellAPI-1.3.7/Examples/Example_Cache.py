# This example demonstrates the use of the cache object used with the CherwellClient.
# Caching is performed for
# 1) Business Object IDs
# 2) URI's
# 3) Business Object Templates
# 4) Business object summaries
# Once an item in in cache its retrieved there first, rather than making another REST Call
