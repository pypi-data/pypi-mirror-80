        #Tk Office 
        
        An Extended framework for `Tkinter/Python`
        
        `TK-Office` is a technology that allows you to code and develope `.exe` for windows machines. Everything is based on Csharp' s
        graphic like appearance...
        Graphics will be native with `Microsoft Windows Workspace`
        
        ####Requirements
        
            Windows OS
            Resolution - 1920x1080 p (1080p)
            Windows 10 and its newer versions (for performance)
        
        ####Installaion 
        
        ```python
        
        >>>pip install TkOffice 
        
        
        ```
        
        ####Use
        
        ![picture]("d:/TkOffice/TkOffice/userkit.jpg")
        
        `built with TkOffice`
        
        
        ######In Order To Build this kind of App Let's get into the widgets
        
        #####Widget - Main Window
        
        There are plenty of ways yoou can instantiate the window in TkOffice.
        
        ######Way - 1: ModTkinterApp(ModTk())
        
        ```python 
        
        #Declaring ModTk in honor of my other package ModTkinter
        
        root   =  ModTk()
        
        '''This here will be your app
           <Contents>
           <Contents>
           <Contents>
        '''
        
        root.mainloop()
        
        ```
        
        ######Way - 2: TkOffice's App
        
        ```python 
        
        #Declaring App
        #App Comes with TkOffice
        
        import TkOffice
        from TkOffice import App
        
        root   =  App()
        
        '''This here will be your app
           <Contents>
           <Contents>
           <Contents>
        '''
        
        root.mainloop()
        
        ```
        
        As Tk-Office's main workspace will be creating apps for Windows 10 UIs, these instances will create a high DPI app
        `i.e: The highest available resolution`
        
        This will also maintain the problem of all DPI problem
        Say , a website when resize has some problem with bigger and smaller buttons and html elements, but `TkOffice` will handle these kinds of problems for you...
        
        #####Widget - Button
        This is a native Button widget of `TkOffice`. It's a megawidget with a frame and a button component..
        But you can do all the configurations- do let's get into it...
        
        ```python 
        
        #importing the button
        
        import TkOffice
        from TkOffice import Button
        
        
        root =  App()
        
        #root's Button 
        
        b = Button(root )
        b.pack()
        
        
        
        root.mainloop()
