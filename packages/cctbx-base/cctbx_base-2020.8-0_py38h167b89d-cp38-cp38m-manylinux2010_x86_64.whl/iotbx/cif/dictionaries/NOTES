This directory is used to store local copies of cif dictionaries.
The purpose is not clear because they are not being used anywhere in the code
except examples.

Included with this distribution are compressed (gzip) copies of the official iucr dictionaries:
  cif_core.dic and cif_mm.dic

The uncompressed versions can be found at:
  ftp://ftp.iucr.org/pub/cifdics/

Modern mmCIF dictionary for model files is
  mmcif_pdbx_v50.dic.gz
can be found at:
  http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/dictionaries/ascii/mmcif_pdbx_v50.dic.gz
