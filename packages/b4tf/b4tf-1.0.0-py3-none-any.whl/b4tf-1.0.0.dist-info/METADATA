# Overview

b4tf is a Python module providing a set of bayesian neural network on
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).


# Installation

b4tf requires following softwares before installation

-   TensorFlow 2.x
-   [TnesorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)
-   Python 3.x


## Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (Recommended)

The following command installs b4tf together with other dependancies.

    pip install b4tf

Depending on your environment, you might need `sudo` or `--user` flag

Then you can install same way;

    cd b4tf
    pip install .


# Implemented Algorithms

Currently, b4tf implements following algorithms. We will implements
more.

-   Probabilistic Backpropagation (PBP) ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05336))


# Lisence

b4tf is available under MIT lisence.
