Description: Key highlights:
        
        * The library focuses exclusively on mobile robots.
        * It provides implementations of standard planning and control algorithms.
        * It provides a framework to facilitate the development of new algorithms easily.
        * Its modular and intuitive design enables quick prototyping and testing of new ideas.
        * The framework and algorithms are written in C++ with python bindings for each functionality.
        
        Even though the library is written primarily using C++, its real-time performance cannot be guaranteed.
        Morphac will primarily be a research focussed library.
