Key highlights:

* The library focuses exclusively on mobile robots.
* It provides implementations of standard planning and control algorithms.
* It provides a framework to facilitate the development of new algorithms easily.
* Its modular and intuitive design enables quick prototyping and testing of new ideas.
* The framework and algorithms are written in C++ with python bindings for each functionality.

Even though the library is written primarily using C++, its real-time performance cannot be guaranteed.
Morphac will primarily be a research focussed library.
