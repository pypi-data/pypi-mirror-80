CORE-POS model importers (direct DB)

.. warning::
   All classes in this module are "direct DB" importers, which will write
   directly to MySQL.  They are meant to be used in dry-run mode only, and/or
   for sample data import to a dev system etc.  They are *NOT* meant for
   production use, as they will completely bypass any CORE business rules logic
   which may exist.
