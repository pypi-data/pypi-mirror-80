Description: # mpsync
        
        **mpsync** is a little tool that you can run during your MicroPython development to automatically upload changes in your code to a board. Simply run it inside the folder you want to sync up and it will create, upload, and delete files from and to your board whenever something changes.
        
        ## How to Use
        
        ```
        usage: mpsync [-h] [-f FOLDER] [-p PORT] [-v]
        
        A tool that continously synchronizes a folder to a MicroPython board.
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -f FOLDER, --folder FOLDER
                                The folder that should be used to synchronize. Default is the current one
          -p PORT, --port PORT  Serial port of the MicroPython board.
          -v, --verbose         Print debug information.
        ```
        
        You can specify the folder you want to sync either by starting the script from the folder or by specifying it in the `--folder` argument. You can specify the location of your MicroPython board with `--port`. Here is an example:
        
        ```
        ~ $ cd micropython_project
        ~/micropython_project $ mpsync -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART
        ```
        
        ## Known Issues
        
        mpsync is currently unable to synchronize the moving of folders. Everything else should be working. If you are having troubles, please open an issue.
        
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        mpsync requires the python libraries `watchdog` and `mpfshell`.
        
        ## Ideas
        
        I have some ideas on how to improve this tool. Let me know via an issue if you have ideas as well!
        
         - Performing an rsync on the complete folder when the script is started
         - Support moving of folders
         - Support specification of waiting time before stuff gets uploaded.
