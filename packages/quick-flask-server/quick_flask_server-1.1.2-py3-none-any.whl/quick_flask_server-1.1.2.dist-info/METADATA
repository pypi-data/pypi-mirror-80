2. Add `run_with_ngrok(app)` to make your Flask app available upon running
```python
# example.py
from flask import Flask
from quick_flask_server import run_with_ngrok

app = Flask(__name__)
run_with_ngrok(app)  # Start ngrok when app is run

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
