features:
  - |
    Changes the design of the VirtualBMC tool. Instead of forking the
    ``vbmc`` command-line tool to become a daemon and serve a single
    libvirt domain, the ``vbmcd`` master process and ``vbmc`` command-line
    client have been introduced. These client-server tools communicate
    over the ZeroMQ queue. The ``vbmcd`` process is responsible for
    herding its children, each child still serves a single libvirt
    domain.
  - |
    The ``vbmc start`` command now supports multiple domains.
upgrade:
  - |
    It is advised to invoke ``vbmcd`` master process on system boot,
    perhaps by a systemd unit file.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecates automatically starting up the ``vbmcd`` daemon process if
    it is not running. This backward-compatibility feature will be removed
    in the OpenStack Stein release.
security:
  - |
    Hardens PID file creation to prevent the symlink attack.
