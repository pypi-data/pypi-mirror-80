## Introduction

The free_surface record style is used for representing a specific free surface plane as stored in the iprPy reference library. Each record is associated with a specific free surface plane and contains characterization metadata and parameters associated with generating the defect in a simulation.

### Version notes

- iprPy version 0.9: the library records have been regenerated based on atomman.defect.free_surface_basis
