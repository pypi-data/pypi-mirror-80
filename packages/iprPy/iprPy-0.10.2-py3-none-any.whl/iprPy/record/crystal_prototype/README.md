## Introduction

The crystal_prototype record style is used for representing crystal prototypes contained within the iprPy reference library. The style is consistent with the atomman system_model format, but lacks element/symbol information and only has atom sites in cell-relative parameters.

### Version notes

- iprPy version 0.9: the contained atomic system configuration was updated to the new atomman.System model format.
