### Potential definition and directory containing associated files

Provides the information associated with an interatomic potential implemented for LAMMPS.

- __potential_file__: the path to the potential_LAMMPS data model used by atomman to generate the proper LAMMPS commands for an interatomic potential.
- __potential_dir__: the path to the directory containing any potential artifacts (eg. eam.alloy setfl files) that are used. If not given, then any required files are expected to be in the working directory where the calculation is executed.
