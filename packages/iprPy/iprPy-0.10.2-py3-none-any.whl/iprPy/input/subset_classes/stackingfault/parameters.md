### Stacking Fault Defect Parameters

Defines a stacking fault defect system to construct and analyze.

- __stackingfault_file__: the path to a stacking-fault record file that contains a set of input parameters associated with a specific generalized stacking fault plane.
- __stackingfault_hkl__ three integers for the Miller (hkl) or Miller-Bravais (hkil) plane to create the free surface on.
- __stackingfault_a1vect_uvw, stackingfault_a2vect_uvw__: three floating point numbers each that define the two directions of shifting associated with the 2D generalized stacking fault. This is taken as a crystallographic vector relative to the box vectors of the initial load configuration file. This is done so that these values have crystallographic meaning instead of just numerical meaning. Both vectors should be within the fault plane. Ideally, they should be set such that applying a full shiftvector shifts the system from one perfect periodic configuration to the next.
- __stackingfault_cellsetting__ indicates the conventional cell setting for the crystal to use for specifying *surface_hkl* if the given unit cell is primitive.  Values are 'p', 'c', 'i', 'a', 'b' and 'c'.  Default value is 'p', i.e. the hkl values will be taken as directly related to the loaded unit cell.
- __stackingfault_cutboxvector__ specifies which of the three box vectors ('a', 'b', or 'c') is to be made non-periodic to create the free surface.  Default value is 'c'.
- __stackingfault_shiftindex__: integer indicating which rigid body shift to apply to the system before making the cut.  This effectively controls the atomic termination planes.
- __stackingfault_faultpos__: specifies a fractional coordinate from 0 to 1 indicating where along the planeaxis direction in the crystal to position the fault plane.  Default value is 0.5, which if stackingfault_even is True will result in the same termination planes at the free surface and the stacking fault.
- __sizemults__: three integers specifying the box size multiplications to use.
- __stackingfault_minwidth__: floating point number stating the minimum width along the cutboxvector direction that the system must be.  The associated sizemult value will be increased if necessary.  Default value is 0.0.
- __stackingfault_even__: boolean indicating if the number of replicas in the cutboxvector direction must be even.  Default value is False.
