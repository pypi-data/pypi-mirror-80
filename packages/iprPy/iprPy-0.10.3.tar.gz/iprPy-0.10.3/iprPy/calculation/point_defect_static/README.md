## Introduction

The point_defect_static calculation style computes the formation energy of a point defect by comparing the energies of a system before and after a point defect is inserted. The resulting defect system is analyzed using a few different metrics to help characterize if the defect reconfigures to a different structure upon relaxation.

- The computed values of the point defect formation energies and elastic dipole tensors are sensitive to the size of the system.  Larger systems minimize the interaction between the defects, and the affect that the defects have on the system's pressure.  Infinite system formation energies can be estimated by measuring the formation energy for multiple system sizes, and extrapolating to 1/natoms = 0.
- Because only a static relaxation is performed, the final configuration might not be the true stable configuration.  Additionally, the stable configuration may not correspond to any of the standard configurations characterized by the point-defect records in the iprPy/library.  Running multiple configurations increases the likelihood of finding the true stable state, but it does not guarantee it.  Alternatively, a dynamic simulation or a genetic algorithm may be more thorough.
- The metrics used to identify reconfigurations are not guaranteed to work for all crystals and defects.  Most notably, the metrics assume that the defect's position coincides with a high symmetry site in the lattice.
- The current version assumes that the initial defect-free base system is an elemental crystal structure.  The formation energy expression needs to be updated to handle multi-component crystals.
