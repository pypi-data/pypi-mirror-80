## Method and Theory

The math in this section uses Voigt notation, where indicies i,j correspond to 1=xx, 2=yy, 3=zz, 4=yz, 5=xz, and 6=xy, and x, y and z are orthogonal box vectors.

An initial system (and corresponding unit cell system) is supplied with box dimensions, $a_i^0$, close to the equilibrium values.  A LAMMPS simulation is performed that evaluates the system's pressures, $P_{i}$, for the initial system as given, and subjected to twelve different strain states corresponding to one of $\epsilon_{i}$ being given a value of $\frac{\Delta \epsilon}{2}$, where $\Delta \epsilon$ is the strain range parameter. Using the $P_{i}$ values obtained from the strained states, the $C_{ij}$ matrix for the system is estimated as

$$ C_{ij} \approx - \frac{P_i(\epsilon_j=\frac{\Delta \epsilon}{2}) - P_i(\epsilon_j=-\frac{\Delta \epsilon}{2})}{\Delta \epsilon}.$$

The negative out front comes from the fact that the system-wide stress state is $\sigma_i = -P_i$. Using $C_{ij}$, an attempt is made to compute the elastic compliance matrix as $S_{ij} = C_{ij}^{-1}$. If successful, new box dimensions are estimated using $S_{ij}$, $a_i^0$, and $P_i$ for the unstrained system

$$ a_i = \frac{a_i^0}{1 - (\sum_{j=1}^3{S_{ij} P_j})}.$$

The system is updated using the new box dimensions. The process is repeated until either $a_i$ converge less than a specified tolerance, $a_i$ diverge from $a_i^0$ greater than some limit, or convergence is not reached after 100 iterations. If the calculation is successful, the final $a_i$ dimensions are reported.
