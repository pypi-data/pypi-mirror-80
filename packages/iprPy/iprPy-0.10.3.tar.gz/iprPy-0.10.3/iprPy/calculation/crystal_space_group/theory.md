## Method and Theory

The calculation relies on the spglib Python package, which itself is a wrapper around the spglib library.  The library analyzes an atomic configuration to determine symmetry elements within a precision tolerance for the atomic positions and the box dimensions.  It also contains a database of information related to the different space groups.
