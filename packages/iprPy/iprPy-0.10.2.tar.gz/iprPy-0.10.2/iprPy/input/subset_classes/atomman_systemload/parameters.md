### Initial system configuration to load

Provides the information associated with loading an atomic configuration.

- __load_file__: the path to the initial configuration file being read in.
- __load_style__: the style/format for the load_file.  The style can be any file type supported by atomman.load()
- __load_options__: a list of key-value pairs for the optional style-dependent arguments used by atomman.load().
- __family__: specifies the configuration family to associate with the loaded file.  This is typically a crystal structure/prototype identifier that helps with linking calculations on the same material together.  If not given and the load_style is system_model, then the family will be taken from the file if included.  Otherwise, the family will be taken as load_file stripped of path and extension.
- __symbols__: a space-delimited list of the potential's atom-model symbols to associate with the loaded system's atom types.  Required if load_file does not contain this information.
- __box_parameters__: *Note that this parameter has no influence on this calculation.*  allows for the specification of new box parameters to scale the loaded configuration by.  This is useful for running calculations based on prototype configurations that do not contain material-specific dimensions.  Can be given either as a list of three or six numbers, with an optional unit of length at the end.  If the unit of length is not given, the specified length_unit (below) will be used.
  - a b c (unit): for orthogonal boxes.
  - a b c alpha beta gamma (unit): for triclinic boxes.  The angles are taken in degrees.
