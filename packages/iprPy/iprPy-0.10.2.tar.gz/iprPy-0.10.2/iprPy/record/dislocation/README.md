## Introduction

The dislocation record style is used for representing a specific dislocation as stored in the iprPy reference library. Each record is associated with a specific dislocation type, and contains characterization metadata and parameters associated with generating the defect in a simulation.

### Version notes

- iprPy version 0.9: the style was renamed from dislocation_monopole as the parameters can be used to generate dislocations in other system configurations.
- iprPy version 0.8: The orientations of the pre-defined dislocation configurations in the dislocation_monopole records have been changed such that the dislocation line is now parallel to the x-axis rather than the z-axis.  This orientation is more compatible to constructing dislocation systems for any crystal system.
