## Introduction

The relax_dynamic calculation style dynamically relaxes an atomic configuration for a specified number of timesteps.  Upon completion, the mean, $\langle X \rangle$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_X$, of all thermo properties, $X$, are computed for a specified range of times.  This method is meant to measure equilibrium properties of bulk materials, both at zero K and at various temperatures.

- The calculation reports the standard deviation, $\sigma_X$ of the measured properties not the standard error of the mean, $\sigma_{\langle X \rangle}$.  The two are related to each other according to $\sigma_{\langle X \rangle} = \sigma_X \sqrt{\frac{C}{N}}$, where $N$ is the number of samples taken of $X$, and $C$ is a statistical inefficiency due to the autocorrelation of the measurements with time.  Obtaining a proper estimate of $\sigma_{\langle X \rangle}$ requires either estimating $C$ from the raw thermo data (not done here), or only taking measurements sporadically to ensure the samples are independent.
- Good (low error) results requires running large simulations for a long time.  The reasons for this are:
  - Systems have to be large enough to avoid issues with fluctuations across the periodic boundaries.
  - Runs must first let the systems equilibrate before meaningful measurements can be taken.
  - The standard deviation, $\sigma$, of thermo properties is proportional to the number of atoms, $N_a$ as $\sigma \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_a}}$.
  - The standard error, $\sigma_x$ of thermo properties is proportional to the number of samples taken, $N$ as $\sigma_x \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$.
