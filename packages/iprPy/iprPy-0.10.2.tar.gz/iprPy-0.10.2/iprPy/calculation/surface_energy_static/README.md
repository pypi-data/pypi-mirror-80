## Introduction

The surface_energy_static calculation style evaluates the formation energy for a free surface by slicing an atomic system along a specific plane.

### Version notes

- 2018-07-09: Notebook added.
- 2019-07-30: Description updated and small changes due to iprPy version.
- 2020-05-22: Version 0.10 update - potentials now loaded from database.
- 2020-09-22: Calculation updated to use atomman.defect.FreeSurface class. Setup and parameter definition streamlined.

### Additional dependencies

### Disclaimers

- [NIST disclaimers](http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/disclaimer.cfm)
- Other atomic configurations at the free surface for certain planar cuts may have lower energies.  The atomic relaxation will find a local minimum, which may not be the global minimum.  Additionally, the material cut is planar perfect and therefore does not explore the effects of atomic roughness.
