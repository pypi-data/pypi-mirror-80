def parse(inscript, singularkeys=[], allsingular=False):
    """
    Parses an input file and returns a dictionary of parameter terms.
    
    These are the parsing rules:
    
    - The first word in a line is taken as the key name of the parameter.
    - All other words are joined together into a single string value for the
      parameter.
    - Words that start with # indicate comments with that word and all words
      to the right of it in the same line being ignored.
    - Any lines with less than two non-comment terms are ignored. In other 
      words, blank lines and lines with keys but not values are skipped over.
    - Multiple values can be assigned to the same term by repeating the key 
      name on a different line. 
    - The keyword arguments can be used to issue an error if multiple values
      are trying to be assigned to terms that should only have a single 
      values.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    inscript : string or file-like-object
        The file, path to file, or contents of the input script to parse.
    singularkeys : list of str, optional
        List of term keys that should not have multiple values.
    allsingular : bool, optional
        Indicates if all term keys should be singular (Default is False).
    
    Returns
    -------
    params : dict
        Dictionary of parsed input key-value pairs
        
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If both singularkeys and allsingular are given, or if multiple values
        found for a singular key.
