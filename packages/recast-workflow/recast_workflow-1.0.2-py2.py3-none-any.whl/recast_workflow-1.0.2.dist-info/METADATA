Recast Workflow
===============

Recast_workflow is a tool for creating new computation workflow for
running physics analyses. The generated workflows are interpreted by the
`Yadage engine`_ and are stored as .yml files. The package comes with a
command line interface as well as a python library.

Read the documentation `here`_.

This was developed as part of IRIS-HEP fellowship. The full proposal can
be viewed `here <https://iris-hep.org/fellows/vovechkin.html>`__.

Installation
