# Recast Workflow

The current progress of the fellowship can be read [here](https://github.com/vladov3000/recast_workflow/blob/master/PROGRESS.md).

Recast_workflow is a tool for creating new computation workflow for running physics analyses. The generated workflows are interpreted by the [Yadage engine](https://github.com/yadage/yadage) and are stored as .yml files. The package comes with a command line interface as well as a python library.

This is currently being developed as part of IRIS-HEP fellowship. The full proposal can be viewed [here](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/vovechkin.html). 

## Development Notes

These will be moved to documentation later but for now, they will be here. To install and run all tests:

    git clone url
    cd recast_workflow
    python3 -m venv ./venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    source dev_setup.sh
    pip install -e .[test]
    pytest
