AMPtk is a series of scripts to process NGS amplicon data using USEARCH and VSEARCH, it can also be used to process any NGS amplicon data and includes databases setup for analysis of fungal ITS, fungal LSU, bacterial 16S, and insect COI amplicons. It can handle Ion Torrent, MiSeq, and 454 data. At least USEARCH v9.1.13 and VSEARCH v2.2.0 are required as of AMPtk v0.7.0.

Install
==================
There are several ways to install AMPtk, the easiest and recommended way is with Conda

.. code-block:: none
     
	#setup your conda env with bioconda, type the following in order to setup channels
	conda config --add channels defaults
	conda config --add channels bioconda
	conda config --add channels conda-forge
	
	#create amptk env (optional)
	conda create -n amptk amptk
	
	#UPDATE 2/9/2019: Conda solver seems to hang, if taking forever try this
	conda create -n amptk
	conda install -n amptk bioconductor-dada2 bioconductor-phyloseq biom-format \
	     biopython matplotlib natsort numpy pandas pigz psutil python-edlib r-base r-dt \
	     r-htmltools r-plotly seaborn vsearch
	conda activate amptk
	conda install amptk
	

You can install the python portion of AMPtk with pip, but you will need to then install the external dependencies such as usearch, vsearch, DADA2 and the amptk stats script will need to install R dependencies.

.. code-block:: none

	pip install amptk 
	
	
Users can also install manually, download a `release <https://github.com/nextgenusfs/amptk/releases>`_. You can also build the latest unreleased version from github:

.. code-block:: none
	
	#clone the repository
	git clone https://github.com/nextgenusfs/amptk.git
	
	#then install, optional add --prefix to control location 
	python setup.py install --prefix /User/Tools/amptk
	
	


Dependencies Requiring Manual Install
=========================================
1) AMPtk utilizes USEARCH9 which must be installed manually from the developer `here <http://www.drive5.com/usearch/download.html>`_.  Obtain the proper version of USEARCH v9.2.64 and softlink into the PATH:

.. code-block:: none

    #make executable
    sudo chmod +x /path/to/usearch9.2.64_i86osx32
    
    #create softlink
    sudo ln -s /path/to/usearch9.2.64_i86osx32 /usr/local/bin/usearch9

1b) (optional) One script also requires USEARCH10, so you can download usearch10 and put into your path as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    #make executable
    sudo chmod +x /path/to/usearch10.0.240_i86osx32
    
    #create softlink
    sudo ln -s /path/to/usearch10.0.240_i86osx32 /usr/local/bin/usearch10

2) (optional) LULU post-clustering OTU table filtering via ``amptk lulu`` requires the R package `LULU <https://github.com/tobiasgf/lulu>`_. Install requires devtools.

.. code-block:: none

    #install devtools if you don't have already
    install.packages('devtools')
    library('devtools')
    install_github("tobiasgf/lulu") 
    
    #not listed as dependency but on my system also requires dpylr
    install.packages('dpylr') or perhaps all of tidyverse install.packages('tidyverse')
    
    #could also install tidyverse from conda
    conda install r-tidyverse
    

Dependencies installed via package managers
============================================
You only need to worry about these dependencies if you installed manually and/or some will be necessary if used homebrew for installation (for example homebrew doesn't install R packages)

1) AMPtk requires VSEARCH, which you can install from `here <https://github.com/torognes/vsearch>`_. Note, if you use homebrew recipe it will be install automatically or can use conda.

.. code-block:: none

    #install vsearch with homebrew
    brew install vsearch
    
    #or with bioconda
    conda install -c bioconda vsearch

2) Several Python modules are also required, they can be installed with pip or conda:

.. code-block:: none

    #install with pip
    pip install -U biopython natsort pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn edlib biom-format psutil
    
    #install with conda
    conda install biopython natsort pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn python-edlib biom-format psutil

3) (optional)  DADA2 denoising algorithm requires installation of R and DADA2.  Instructions are located `here <http://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/>`_.

.. code-block:: none

    #install with conda/bioconda
    conda install r-base bioconductor-dada2

4) (optional) To run some preliminary community ecology stats via ``amptk stats`` you will also need the R package `Phyloseq <https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/>`_.  One way to install with conda:

.. code-block:: none

    #install with conda/bioconda
    conda install r-base bioconductor-phyloseq

    
Run from Docker
==================
There is a base installation of AMPtk on Docker at nextgenusfs/amptk-base. Because usearch9 and usearch10 are required but must be personally licensed, here are the directions to get a working AMPtk docker image.

1) Download the Dockerfile build file.

.. code-block:: none

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextgenusfs/amptk/master/Dockerfile

2) Download usearch9.2.64 and usearch10.0.240 for linux (32 bit version) `here <http://www.drive5.com/usearch/download.html>`_.


3) Build AMPtk docker image

.. code-block:: none

    docker build -t amptk -f Dockerfile .

4) You can now launch the docker image like so (make sure files you need are in current directory)

.. code-block:: none

    docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/work amptk /bin/bash
