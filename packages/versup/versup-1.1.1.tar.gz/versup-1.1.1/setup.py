If you provide an increment, it will get the\nlast version number from either the latest git tag that has a valid version,\nor from the default version in the config file.\n\n# Configuration\n\nOn intial launch, versup copies a default config to your home directory (`~/.config/versup.json`) which has some good defaults.\n\n```\n{\n    "force": False,  # Force the command without prompting the user\n    "silent": False,  # Minimize the amount of logs\n    "files": {},  # A map of `relativeFilePath: [regex, replacement, regexFlags?] | [regex, replacement, regexFlags?][]`\n    "version": {\n        "enabled": True,  # Bump the version number\n        "initial": "0.0.0",  # Initial version\n        "increments": [\n            "major",\n            "minor",\n            "patch",\n            "premajor",\n            "preminor",\n            "prepatch",\n            "prerelease",\n            "custom",\n        ],  # List of available increments to pick from\n    },\n    "changelog": {\n        "enabled": True,  # Enable changelog auto-updates\n        "create": False,  # Create the changelog file if it doesn"t exist\n        "open": True,  # Open the changelog file after bumping\n        "file": "CHANGELOG.md",  # Name of the changelog file\n        "version": "### Version [version]",  # Template for the version line\n        "commit": "- [message]",  # Template for the commit line\n        "separator": "\\n",  # Template for the separator between versions sections\n    },\n    "commit": {\n        "enabled": True,  # Commit the changes automatically\n        "message": "Update version to [version]",  # Template for the commit message\n    },\n    "tag": {\n        "enabled": True,  # Tag the bump commit\n        "name": "v[version]",  # Template for the name of the tag\n    },\n    "tokens": {\n        "date": {\n            "format": "%Y-%m-%d"  # Python datetime format to use when generating the `[date]` token\n        },\n        "version_date": {\n            "format": "%Y-%m-%d"  # Python datetime format to use when generating the `[version_date]` token\n        },\n    },\n    "scripts": {\n        "prebump": "",  # Script to execute before bumping the version\n        "postbump": "",  # Script to execute after bumping the version\n        "prechangelog": "",  # Script to execute before updating the changelog\n        "postchangelog": "",  # Script to execute after updating the changelog\n        "precommit": "",  # Script to execute before committing\n        "postcommit": "",  # Script to execute after committing\n        "pretag": "",  # Script to execute before tagging\n        "posttag": "",  # Script to execute after tagging\n        "prerelease": "",  # Script to execute before releasing\n        "postrelease": "",  # Script to execute after releasing\n    },\n}\n```\n\nYou can edit this file to affect all bumps, or create a `.versup.json` file in your project root\nand versup will use these values to override the global ones.\n\nIt is worth noting that the default config will be merged at runtime into the global config so that\nany new settings that get added to the config are present. The global config will remain unaffected however.\nNew config settings need to be added manually in the meantime. There is a plan to automate this in future releases.\n\n# Template tags\n\nIn various places you can define what text to use for commit messages, or tags etc.\nThese support tag fields that are replaced with relevant information. Known fields are:\n\n- version: The new version\n- message: The new commit message\n- date: Today\'s date formatted according to `tokens/date/format` in the config\n- version_date: Today\'s date formatted according to `tokens/version_date/format` in the config\n- hash: The new commit hash, full length\n- hash4: The new commit hash, first four characters\n- hash7: The new commit hash, first seven characters\n- hash8: The new commit hash, first eight characters\n- author_name: The author name from the git config\n- author_email: The author email from the git config\n\n# Updating files\n\nversup can update versions in files. The way this works is by configuring a regex\nfor each file that you want to update. So for example:\n\n```\n"files": {\n    "README.rst": [\n      ["Version ([\\\\d\\\\.]+) ", "Version [version] "],\n      ["Version is ([\\\\d\\\\.]+)", "Version is [version]"]\n    ]\n  },\n```\n\nHere the file `README.rst` is updated by matching a regex `Version ([\\\\d\\\\.]+)`\nwhich will match any text like `Version 1.3` or `Version 1.3.7`. They are standard\nregular expressions. The text that is matched is then replaced with the next argument\n`Version [version]` where `[version]` is the new version. You can regex and replace on\nanything really.\n\nThe supported increments are those supported by [Python Semver](https://python-semver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#raising-parts-of-a-version)\n\n- major\n- minor\n- patch\n- prerelease\n- build\n\n# Scripts\n\nThere are a number of pre and post scripts that can be executed at various\nstages of the bump process. These are under the `scripts` section. They are\ncalled as-is and receive the new version number as the only argument. They\ncan be anything, shell scripts, python scripts, etc, but they must be\nexecutable in a regular shell, as they will be invoked as such.\n\nFull Read The Docs can be found at [https://versup.readthedocs.io](https://versup.readthedocs.io)\n',
