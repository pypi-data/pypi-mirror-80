Description: # 👩‍⚕️ MCL Sickbay
        
        "MCL Sickbay" is the data model and object-relational mapping for the clinical data application of the [Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions](https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/).
        
        
        ## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started
        
        The "Sickbay" software provides a [Python](https://python.org/) based API into a data model (a series of related classes) and takes advantage of [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as the object-relational mapper. This section will help you get started.
        
        
        ### 📀 The Database
        
        For this project, we're using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). You can create a PostgreSQL database to use with this software as follows:
        
        ```console
        dropdb --if-exists clinical_data
        dropuser --if-exists mcl
        
        createuser \
            --createdb \
            --inherit \
            --login \
            --no-createrole \
            --no-superuser \
            mcl
        
        
        createdb --encoding=UTF8 --owner=mcl clinical_data
        ```
        
        
        ### 🖥 The Software
        
        To use this software, simply add `mcl.sickbay` as a dependency to your project or install it into your Python virtual environment.
        
        You can develop, build, and test the package locally as follows:
        
        ```console
        python3 bootstrap.py
        bin/buildout
        bin/test
        ```
        
        You can run `bin/create-demo-db` to populate a PostgreSQL database with the schema of the Sickbay data model. Add ``-add-test-data`` to include some test data.
        
        To publish this software, try [Twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/).
        
        
        ### 🔢 Versioning
        
        We use the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) philosophy for versioning this software. For versions available, see the [release history](https://pypi.org/project/mcl.sickbay/#history).
