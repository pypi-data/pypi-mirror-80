# Extract Env

This project was created to solve the recurring problem of adding an environment variable to the settings.py with [python-decouple](https://github.com/henriquebastos/python-decouple) while not adding the same variable to the .env file. It reads the settings.py file and then creates the .env file with all environment variables already set.

## How to install

```bash
pip install env-automatically
```

## How to use

1 - Go to the Django project folder where settings.py is.

2 - Run command:

```bash
env-automatically .
```

3 - The file **.env** will be created in the same folder of settings.py.
