def Z_loss(omega, L, C, R):
    """Impedance for high loss materials, where LCR are in parallel.

    Described for instance in [Kordzadeh2016]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    omega: :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        List of frequencies.
    L: double
        inductance
    C: double
        capacitance
    R: double
        resistance

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`numpy.ndarray`, complex
        Impedance array

    Notes
    -----

    As mentioned in [Kordzadeh2016]_, the unit of the
    capacitance is pF and the unit of the inductance
    is nH.
