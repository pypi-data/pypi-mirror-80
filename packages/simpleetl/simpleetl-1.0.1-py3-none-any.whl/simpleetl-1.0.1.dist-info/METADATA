SimpleETL - ETL Processing by Simple Specifications
===================================================

SimpleETL er an ETL tool developed by FlexDanmark to easily handling processing of data
from user-defined data sources and automatically generates a dimensionally modelled
data warehouse.

SimpleETL is developed to work with the PostgreSQL DBMS backend with psycopg2 as
database adapter.

Features
--------
- Automatically generates data warehouse dimensional model (star schema)
- Can track changes of facts
- User-defined automatic fact table partitioning
- Handle deleted facts
- Ensures data quality by type and value checking
- Provides a wide range of default data types and allows user to define their own


Installation
------------
SimpleETL can be installed in multiple ways. The simples is to receive (or build) a wheel file
and install this using pip.

In the future SimpleETL is supposed to be available from the PyPI package repository.

Dependencies
````````````
SimpleETL requires the psycopg2-binary and the pygrametl package for database
PostgreSQL database connections and table handling.

It is highly recommended to build and install SimpleETL in a virtual environment::

    $ python -m venv venv       # Create virtuel environment in venv subfolder
    $ source venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment

Build and install a wheel package (using pip)
`````````````````````````````````````````````
SimpleETL can also be installed from a wheel package using the ``pip`` command::

    $ pip install simpleetl-2.3.0-py3-none-any.whl

To manually build a .whl file for distribution and installation the wheel package is required.
Then a SimpleETL wheel can be build with the following, resulting in a .whl file in the dist folder::

    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

Build and install from source
`````````````````````````````
SimpleETL be installed using ``setup.py`` if you have downloaded the source package locally::

    $ python setup.py build
    $ sudo python setup.py install


Example usages
--------------
From the source repository multiple code examples can be found in the examples folder
