Jvis
====

Emerging single-cell genomics technologies profile multiple types of molecules
within a single cell. A fundamental step in the analysis of the produced high
dimensional data is their visualization using dimensionality reduction techniques
such as t-SNE and UMAP. We developed Jvis, a dimensionality reduction framework
that naturally generalizes t-SNE and UMAP to the joint visualization of
multimodal omics data. Our approach  automatically learns a weighting of individual
modalities from the data that promotes discriminative features but suppresses
random noise. On 8 single-cell multimodal data sets across 5 different technologies,
Jvis produced a unified embedding that better agrees with known cell states and RNA
and protein velocity landscapes compared to unimodal representations.

The details for the underlying mathematics can be found in

----------
Installing
----------

Requirements:

* Python 3.6 or greater
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* numba


**Install Options**

PyPI install, presuming you have numba and sklearn and all its requirements
(numpy and scipy) installed:

.. code:: bash

    pip install testJvis-learn

If you have a problem with pip installation then we'd suggest installing
the dependencies manually using anaconda followed by pulling umap from pip:

.. code:: bash

    conda install numpy scipy
    conda install scikit-learn
    conda install numba
    pip install testJvis-learn

---------------
How to use Jvis
---------------

The Jvis package inherits from sklearn TSNE, and UMAP. Therefore, all parameters of
tSNE and UMAP are naturally extended for Jvis.

An example of making use of these options:

.. code:: python

    from Jvis import JUMAP, JTSNE
    import numpy as np

    # Create a toy example from a random distribution (n_cells = 500)
    rna_rand = np.random.rand(500, 100)
    adt_rand = np.random.rand(500, 15)
    data = {'rna': rna_rand, 'adt': adt_rand} # create a dictionary of modalities.

    # Run joint TSNE of the two "random" modalities.
    embedding_jtsne = JTSNE(n_components=2).fit_transform(data)

    # Run joint UMAP of the two "random" modalities.
    embedding_jumap = JUMAP(n_neighbors=20,
                            min_dist=0.3,
                            metric='correlation').fit_transform(data)
