Purpose
-------
This library provides data structures and methods for a basic `oblivious transfer (OT) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_transfer>`_ protocol defined in `work by Chou and Orlandi <https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/267.pdf>`_. Thanks to the underlying `oblivious <https://pypi.org/project/oblivious/>`_ library, users of this library have the option of relying either on pure Python implementations of cryptographic primitives or on wrappers for `libsodium <https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium>`_.

Package Installation and Usage
------------------------------
The package is available on PyPI::

    python -m pip install otc

The library can be imported in the usual ways::

    import otc
    from otc import *

Testing and Conventions
-----------------------
All unit tests are executed and their coverage is measured when using `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.io/>`_ (see ``setup.cfg`` for configution details)::

    nosetests

Alternatively, all unit tests are included in the module itself and can be executed using `doctest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>`_::

    python otc/otc.py -v

Style conventions are enforced using `Pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_::

    pylint otc
