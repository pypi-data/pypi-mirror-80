Description: # mil: multiple instance learning library for Python
        
        When working on a research problem, I found myself with the [multiple instance learning (MIL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_instance_learning) framework, which I found quite interesting and unique. After carefully reviewing the literature, I decided to try few of the algorithms on the problem I was working on, but for my surprise, there was no standard, easy, and updated MIL library for any programming language. So... here we are. <br/>
        The mil library tries to achieve reproducible and productive research using the MIL framework.

        ### Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install mil.
        
        ```bash
        pip install mil
        ```

        ### Features
        
        The overall implementation tries to be user-friendly as possible. That's why most of it constructed on top of [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and [tensorflow.keras](tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras).

        #### data
        Very well known datasets of the multiple instance learning framework have been added to the library. For each of the datasets a train and test split 
        has been done for reproducibility purposes. The API is similar to the tensorflow datasets in order to create and experiment in a fast and easy way.
        
        ```python
        # importing all the datasets modules
        from mil.data.datasets import musk1, musk2, protein, elephant, corel_dogs, \
                                      ucsb_breast_cancer, web_recommendation_1, birds_brown_creeper, \
                                      mnist_bags
        # load the musk1 dataset
        (bags_train, y_train), (bags_test, y_test) = musk1.load()
        ```
        Also, the mnist_bags dataset has been created. The principal reason of creating this dataset is to have a good benchmark to evaluate the instances predictions. Or more specifically, if we can classify correctly a bag, can we detect which instance/s caused this classification? 
        In the mnist_bags dataset, there are 3 different types of problems with their own dataset.
        
        1) The bag 'b' is positive if the instance '7' is contained in 'b' <br/>
        ```python
        # importing all the datasets modules
        from mil.data.datasets import mnist_bags
        
        # load the mnist_bags
        (bags_train, y_train), (bags_test, y_test) = mnist_bags.load()
        ```
        2) The bag 'b' is positive if the instance '2' and '3' are contained in 'b'  <br/>
        ```python
        # importing all the datasets modules
        from mil.data.datasets import mnist_bags
        
        # load the mnist_bags 2 and 3
        (bags_train, y_train), (bags_test, y_test) = mnist_bags.load_2_and_3()
        ```
        3) The bag 'b' is positive if the instance '4' and '2' are located in consecutive instances in 'b'  <br/>
        ```python
        # importing all the datasets modules
        from mil.data.datasets import mnist_bags
        
        # load the mnist_bags 4 2
        (bags_train, y_train), (bags_test, y_test) = mnist_bags.load_42()
        ```
        
        #### bag_representation
        In multiple instance learning, bag representation is the technique that consists in obtaining a unique vector representing all the bag.
        The classes implemented in the mil.bag_representation inherit from BagRepresentation base class which is a wrapper to sklearn transformer which have to implement fit and transform method.
        
        - MILESMapping
        - DiscriminativeMapping
        - ArithmeticMeanBagRepresentation
        - MedianBagRepresentation
        - GeometricMeanBagRepresentation
        - MinBagRepresentation
        - MaxBagRepresentation
        - MeanMinMaxBagRepresentation
        
        ```python
        from mil.bag_representation import MILESMapping, DiscriminativeMapping, ArithmeticMeanBagRepresentation, \
                                           MedianBagRepresentation, GeometricMeanBagRepresentation, MinBagRepresentation, \
                                           MaxBagRepresentation, MeanMinMaxBagRepresentation
        ```
        
        ---
        
        #### dimensionality_reduction
        A wrapper to sklearn.decomposition and sklearn.feature_selection.
        
        ```python
        # for example import sklearn PCA
        from mil.dimensionality_reduction import PCA
        ```
        
        #### metrics
        Includes a manager to handle all the metrics, some custom metric and a wrapper of tensorflow.keras.metrics. Custom metrics have to inherit from Metrics base class and implement methods update_state, result, and reset_states.
        
        ```python
        # importing a custom metric
        from mil.metrics import Specificity
        
        # importing a keras metric
        from mil.metrics import AUC
        ```
        
        #### models
        It contains all the end-to-end models. All the models implement a sklearn-like structure with fit, predict, and sometimes get_positive_instances when the method allows it.
        - MILES
        - APR
        - AttentionDeepPoolingMil
        
        ```python
        # importing mil models
        from mil.models import APR, AttentionDeepPoolingMil, MILES
        
        # importing sklearn models
        from mil.models import RandomForestClassifier, SVC
        ```
        It is also a wrapper to sklearn.svm, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.linear_model, and sklearn.neighbors.
        
        #### preprocessing
        It contains few transformers to normalize and standarize bags of type list, and is also a wrapper to sklearn.preprocessing.
        
        ```python
        # standarize bags of lists
        from mil.preprocessing import StandarizerBagsList
        ```
        
        #### utils
        It contains few utility functions, such as bags2instances, padding, progress bar ...
        
        ```python
        # for example importing bags2instances function
        from mil.utils.utils import bags2instances
        ```
        
        #### validators
        A wrapper to sklearn.model_selection. Includes all the validation strategies to be used in the training process.
        
        ```python
        # for example importing sklearn KFold
        from mil.validators import KFold
        
        valid = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True)
        ```
        
        #### trainer
        It is the central part of the library, it allows to train, and evaluate models in a very simple and intuitive way.
        It has 4 principal methods.
        
        1) prepare(model, preprocess_pipeline=[], metrics=[]). <br/>
        Which is kind of what 'compile' method is for keras models. What it does is preparing the training and evaluation routine.
        The 'model' parameter accepts any of the mil.models objects. The 'preprocess_pipeline' parameter is a list containing all the transforming operations we wish to do before inputing the data into the 'model' object, basically accepts any sklearn transformer. The 'metrics' accepts some strings of typical metrics, or the callables modules from the metrics.<br/>
        
        2) fit(X_train, y_train, X_val=None, y_val=None, groups=None, validation_strategy=None, sample_weights=None, verbose=1) <br/>
        Which is the method to train the model. It also handles a sample_weights parameters and mil.validators objects or custom validations splits. <br/>
        
        3) predict(X_train, y_train, X_val=None, y_val=None, groups=None, validation_strategy=None, sample_weights=None, verbose=1) <br/>
        Which is the method to train the model. It also handles a sample_weights parameters and mil.validators objects or custom validations splits. <br/>
        
        4) get_positive_instances(X) <br/>
        For the models who have implemented this method, it returns the result. <br/>
