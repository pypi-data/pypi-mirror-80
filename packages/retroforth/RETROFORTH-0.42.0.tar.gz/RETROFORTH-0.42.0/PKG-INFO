Description: 
        
        Welcome to RETRO, my personal take on the Forth language. This is a modern system primarily targetting desktop, mobile, and servers, though it can also be used on some larger (ARM, MIPS32)
        embedded systems.
        
        The language is Forth. It is untyped, uses a stack to pass data between functions called words, and a dictionary which tracks the word names and data structures.
        
        But it's not a traditional Forth. RETRO draws influences from many sources and takes a unique approach to the language.
        
        RETRO has a large vocabulary of words. Keeping a copy of the Glossary on hand is highly recommended as you learn to use RETRO.
