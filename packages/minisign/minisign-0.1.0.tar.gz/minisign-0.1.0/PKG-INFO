# Minisign Python

This is a pure Python implementation of [Frank Denis](https://twitter.com/jedisct1/)' [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/), following the [specifications](SPECS.md) copied from there.  
Currently following version *0.9*.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: this is currently under heavy development, and it hasn't undergone an external security assessment.

## Goals

* Compatible public interface: all commands and options must be 100% compatible and with same results.
* Usage as CLI and as Python module.
* Follow [semver](https://semver.org/).

### Secondary goals

* Small amount of dependencies (I would love to keep it just to cryptolibraries).
* If possible, maintain current active Python versions (3.7+).

## Milestones

- [x] Define goals and license.
- [x] Create initial project structure.
   - [x] Code structure.
   - [x] Contribution guidelines.
   - [x] Pipeline.
- [ ] Achieve basic functionality:
   - [ ] Create key pair.
   - [ ] Verify signature.
   - [ ] Sign.
- [ ] Ensure coverage 100%.
- [ ] Make first release.
- [ ] Add remaining options.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* PyNaCl 1.3+
