# govee-api-laggat Package

Python implementation of the govee API 1.0 to control the cheap and colorful LED strips.

## API Key

To get an api key you need to install the 'Govee Home' app on your mobile and browse the user tab - About - Request API key. Usually you get your key within seconds by mail.

I'm just starting here, implementation is about to change as needed.

Feel free to fork and start a pull request in your feature/bug branch. If you cannot fix or extend it yourself, you may want to add an issue here, but it may take a bit longer.

I want to use this package in an Home Assistant Component to control my new light strips.
