Description: # asyncio-pool
        
        Pool of asyncio coroutines with familiar interface. Supports python 3.5+ (including PyPy 6+, which is also 3.5 atm)
        
        AioPool makes sure _no more_ and _no less_ (if possible) than `size` spawned coroutines are active at the same time. _spawned_ means created and scheduled with one of the pool interface methods, _active_ means coroutine function started executing it's code, as opposed to _waiting_ -- which waits for pool space without entering coroutine function.
