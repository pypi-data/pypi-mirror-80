    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Dataset. Set to zero if no dataset is required.
    capex : float or callable
        Capital expenses [$/kW(h)]. Depends on size. Can be a callable
        function that returns capital cost starting from year zero to end of
        project lifetime.
    opex_fix : float or callable
        Fixed yearly operating expenses [$/kW(h) yr]. Depends on size. Can be
        a callable function that returns the fixed operating cost starting
        from year zero to end of project lifetime.
    opex_var : float or callable
        Variable yearly operating expenses [$/kWh yr]. Depends on energy
        produced. Can be a callable function that returns the variable
        operating cost starting from year zero to end of project lifetime.
    opex_use : float or callable
        Variable yearly operating expenses [$/h yr]. Depends on amount of
        usage. Can be a callable function that returns the variable
        operating cost starting from year zero to end of project lifetime.
    name_solid : str
        Label used for the power output. Appears as a solid area in powerflows
        and as a header in .csv files. Usually the name of the component.
    color_solid : str
        Hex code (e.g. '#33CC33') of the color corresponding to name_solid.
        Appears in the solid area in powerflows.
    name_line : str
        Label used for the power output. Appears as a line in powerflows
        and as a header in .csv files. Usually the name of a Load component or
        Storage state of charge.
    color_line : str
        Hex code (e.g. '#33CC33') of the color corresponding to name_line.
        Appears in the line in powerflows.
    life : float
        Lifetime [y] of the component.
    fail_prob : float
        Probability of failure of the component.
    is_fail : bool
        True if failure probabilities should be simulated.
    is_re : bool
        True if the resource is renewable.
    is_elec : bool
        True if the resource is electrical.
    is_water : bool
        True if the resource is water.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    repex : float or callable
        Replacement costs [USD/kW(h)]. Depends on size. Equal to CapEx by
        default. Can be a callable function that returns replacement costs
        starting from year zero to end of project lifetime.
    num_case : int
        Number of scenarios to simultaneously simulate. This is set by the
        Control module.
    size : int
        Size of the component [kW]. This is set by the Control module.
