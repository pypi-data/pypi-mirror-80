# Figure Generator

This is an awesome figure generator. It generates figures in pdf-, html- and pptx-format.
The following image shows the output of one of our test files ("tests/pool.py"):

This tool might help not only to create final figures, but also to analyze images faster: We offer a bunch of error metrics that allows not only to compare images visually but also mathematically.

Why did we implemented a figure generator?

In rendering research, it is quite common to create figures of "comparison"-type. Meaning, that we start with a set of generated images, that needs to be compared. Oftentimes, one rendered scene is not enough, therefore, we need several comparison figures - at best in a similar or same style as the other created figures.

We support _grids_ (images that are grid-like arranged) and simple _line-plotting_. To get a further understanding what _grids_ are, you might want to have a look at our tutorial ([Tutorial.ipynb](Tutorial.ipynb)).

## Quickstart

### Linux / Mac OS

```
./setup.sh
```

### Windows

Install the pre-built OpenEXR binaries: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#openexr

Dummy Note -to be more precise-: Open Powershell in folder where the downloaded binary file is:
``` 
python -m pip install .\OpenEXR-_VERSION_.whl
```

Afterwards, go to the main folder of the figure generator and run:
```
./setup.ps1
```
Dummy Note -in case this fails-: You might need to change execution policy to run the setup. Therefore, run in admin-Powershell:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
./setup.ps1
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.5+ (and in path)
- LaTeX

The following python packages need to be installed:
```
python -m pip install --user matplotlib python-pptx pyexr scipy opencv-python wheel
```
Note that matplotlib version >3.2.1 is required for the constrained layout feature.
In case of install issues on Windows, try the pre-built OpenEXR binaries:
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#openexr

## Testing

First, set PYTHONPATH to include the root folder of this repository.
Alternatively, you can install the package via pip, as discussed below. Then, you can run test as follows:
```
cd tests
python -m single_module
python -m multi_module
...
```

## Getting started

Build and install the package:
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
python -m pip install --user --upgrade --force-reinstall ./dist/figuregen-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

To get an inspiration on how to create figures, you might have a look at our tests or our [tutorial](Tutorial.ipynb).
