RELEASE 0.9.5

In this release we have added:

 1. Support for PostgreSQL sources via SQL Alchemy. Now parts of PythonQL queries that can
   be pushed to a Postgres source will be translated into SQL and run in the database. More
   details are available in PythonQL documentation.
 2. Join hints: you can specificy nested-loops and index-joins now and specificy which side
   should be indexed/iterated over. More details are available in PythonQL documentation.
 3. Minor bug fixes
