# Winix Controller

This is a Python library for controlling Winix C545 Air Purifier
devices. I reverse-engineered the API calls from the Android app. There
are a few weird idiosyncrasies with the Winix backends.

Included in this package is a CLI program `winixctl`.

## Setup


## `winixctl` CLI

```
~/dev/winix(master*) Â» winixctl                                                                                                                                                                                                 hfern@arrakis
