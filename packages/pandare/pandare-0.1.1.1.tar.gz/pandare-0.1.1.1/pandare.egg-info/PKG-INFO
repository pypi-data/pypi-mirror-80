Description: PYPANDA: PANDA's Python Interface
        ========
        Overview
        --
        PYPANDA is a python interface to PANDA. With PYPANDA, you can quickly develop plugins
        to analyze behavior of a running system, record a system and analyze replays, or do
        nearly anything you can do using PANDA's C/C++ APIs.
        
        Autogenerated python documentation is available at [panda-re.github.io/](https://panda-re.github.io/).
        
        Installation
        --
        This pip package is only tested on `x86_64` Ubuntu 18.04.
        It is currently only a binray distribution and will certainly only work on `x86_64` hosts as pre-built panda libraries are included.
        Prior to using pandare **you must install some dependencies**:
        ```
        apt install libvdeplug-dev libpng16-16
        ```
        
        Then simply install with `pip3 install pandare`. From there, you'll be able to use PANDA with:
        
        ```
        from pandare import Panda
        ...
        ```
        
        
        This is a beta release
        ---
        * Although PANDA is fairly stable, this interface is new and subject to change significantly prior to version 1.0.
        
        * This package is manually generated and may fall behind the code on GitHub.
        
        * Due to size limits on pypi, this package does not include support for PPC guests or big-endian MIPS. If you'd like those, please build from source.
