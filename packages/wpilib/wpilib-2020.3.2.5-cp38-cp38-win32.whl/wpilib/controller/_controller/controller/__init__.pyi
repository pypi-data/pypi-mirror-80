class RamseteController():
    """
    Ramsete is a nonlinear time-varying feedback controller for unicycle models
    that drives the model to a desired pose along a two-dimensional trajectory.
    Why would we need a nonlinear control law in addition to the linear ones we
    have used so far like PID? If we use the original approach with PID
    controllers for left and right position and velocity states, the controllers
    only deal with the local pose. If the robot deviates from the path, there is
    no way for the controllers to correct and the robot may not reach the desired
    global pose. This is due to multiple endpoints existing for the robot which
    have the same encoder path arc lengths.

    Instead of using wheel path arc lengths (which are in the robot's local
    coordinate frame), nonlinear controllers like pure pursuit and Ramsete use
    global pose. The controller uses this extra information to guide a linear
    reference tracker like the PID controllers back in by adjusting the
    references of the PID controllers.

    The paper "Control of Wheeled Mobile Robots: An Experimental Overview"
    describes a nonlinear controller for a wheeled vehicle with unicycle-like
    kinematics; a global pose consisting of x, y, and theta; and a desired pose
    consisting of x_d, y_d, and theta_d. We call it Ramsete because that's the
    acronym for the title of the book it came from in Italian ("Robotica
    Articolata e Mobile per i SErvizi e le TEcnologie").
