**django-renderpdf** is a Django app to render django templates as PDF files.

Introduction
------------

Rendering PDFs for web developers is generally pretty non-trivial, and there's
no common approach to doing this. django-renderpdf attempts to allow reusing
all the known tools and skills when generating a PDF file in a Django app:

* Use Django template files, which are internally rendered as HTML and them PDF
  files.
* Use staticfiles app to include any CSS or image files.
* Simply subclass a ``PDFView`` class which has an interface very similar to
  Django's own built-in ``View`` classes.

Background
----------

django-renderpdf actually started out as code on multiple of my own projects
(including some public ones).

After some time, it became clear that I'd been copy-pasting PDF-related bits
across different projects, and since co-workers expressed interest in this
design (using the Django templating system to generate PDFs), it finally made
sense to move this into a separate library.

Because of this, documentation is still a work in progress (the code far
outdates this API being public), and while unit tests are lacking, this code
has had ample field testing.

Usage example
-------------

Hint: Though ``PDFView``'s methods has extensive docstrings you should check.

Let's assume we have some ``Shipment`` object, and we want to print PDF labels for it.
Here's a usage code example for a view that does that.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin
    from django_renderpdf.views import PDFView


    class LabelsView(LoginRequiredMixin, PDFView):
        """Generate labels for some Shipments.

        A PDFView behaves pretty much like a TemplateView, so you can treat it as such.
        """
        template_name = 'my_app/labels.html'

        def get_context_data(self, *args, **kwargs):
            """Pass some extra context to the template."""
            context = super().get_context_data(*args, **kwargs)

            context['shipments'] = models.Shipment.objects.filter(
                batch_id=kwargs['pk'],
            )

            return context

And in ``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import path

    path(
        '/shipments/labels/<int:pk>/',
        views.LabelsView.as_view(),
        name='shipment_labels',
    ),

Changelog
---------

v2.1.0
~~~~~~

- Add handling of relative URLs.
  CSS, image files, and other resources will be resolved using Django's internal URL
  routing. This includes scenarios like serving static or media files via Django, or
  serving thing like custom css via custom Django views.
- Drop support for Python 3.5.

v2.0.1
~~~~~~

- Improve handling of remote ``staticfiles``.

v2.0.0
~~~~~~

- Support Python 3.7 and 3.8.
- Support Django 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1.
- Drop support for Django < 2.2.
