Description: # Placekey-py
        
        A Python library for working with [Placekeys](https://placekey.io). Documentation for this package can be found [here](https://placekey.github.io/placekey-py/), and documentation for the Placekey service API can be found [here](https://docs.placekey.io/).
        
        ## Usage
        
        The basic functionality of the Placekey library is conversion between Placekeys and latitude-longitude coordinates.
        
        ```python
        >>> import placekey as pk
        >>> lat, long = 0.0, 0.0
        >>> pk.geo_to_placekey(lat, long)
        '@dvt-smp-tvz'
        ```
        
        ```python
        >>> pk.placekey_to_geo('@dvt-smp-tvz')
        (0.00018033323813810344, -0.00018985758738881587)
        ```
        
        The library also allows for conversion between Placekeys and [H3 indices](https://github.com/uber/h3-py).
        
        ```python
        >>> pk.placekey_to_h3('@dvt-smp-tvz')
        '8a754e64992ffff'
        ```
        
        ```python
        >>> pk.h3_to_placekey('8a754e64992ffff')
        '@dvt-smp-tvz'
        ```
        
        The distance in meters between two Placekeys can be found with the following function.
        
        ```python
        >>> pk.placekey_distance('@dvt-smp-tvz', '@5vg-7gq-tjv')
        12795124.895573696
        ```
        
        An upper bound on the maximal distance in meters between two Placekeys based on the length of their shared prefix is provided by `placekey.get_prefix_distance_dict()`.
        ```python
        >>> pk.get_prefix_distance_dict()
        {0: 20040000.0,
         1: 20040000.0,
         2: 2777000.0,
         3: 1065000.0,
         4: 152400.0,
         5: 21770.0,
         6: 8227.0,
         7: 1176.0,
         8: 444.3,
         9: 63.47}
        ```
        
        Placekeys found in a data set can be partially validated by
        
        ```python
        >>> pk.placekey_format_is_valid('222-227@dvt-smp-tvz')
        True
        ```
        
        ```python
        >>> pk.placekey_format_is_valid('@123-456-789')
        False
        ```
        
        ## Notebooks
