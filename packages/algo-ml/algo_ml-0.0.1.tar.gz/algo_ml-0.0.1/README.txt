# This is Algo-ML
This is a machine learning module/library. Feel free to use any of the code.

## How to use: 
### Regression
Call the train function on the model, giving the data as the first input and there is no other input. The input data looks like this: [[x, y], [x, y], ........].

### KMeansClustering
Call the train function giving the data as input which should look like this [[x, y, ....], [x, y, ....], [x, y, ....], .......].

### KNearestNeighbor
Give it data to train on (just stores the data), which takes the form [[x, y, ......, LABEL], [x, y, ......, LABEL], ...........]. Use the predict function then to predict a label
for a particular point.



### That's it! :)
