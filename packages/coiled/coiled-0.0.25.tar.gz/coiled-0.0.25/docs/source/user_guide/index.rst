ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Coiled's documentation!

What is Coiled?
---------------

`Coiled <https://coiled.io>`_ is a deployment-as-a-service library for scaling Python. It takes the devops out of
data science to enable data professionals to spend less time setting up networking, managing fleets of
Docker images, creating AWS IAM roles, etc. and more time on their real job.
