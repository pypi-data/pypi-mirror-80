        > Automate your iTerm layouts and session setup
        
        Define your iTerm layouts, commands to execute in the form of yaml files and run a single command to have iTerm prepare itself for you to start working.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * iTerm2 Version 3.3 or later
        * Python 3.5 or later
        
        ## Installation
        
        Make sure that you are running Python 3.5 or later
        
        ```shell
        pip install itomate
        ```
        
        [Enable Python API usage](./.github/assets/preferences.png) in iTerm preferences.
        
        ```shell
        itomate --version
        ```
        
        ## Example
        > The layout, number of panes, tabs, titles and commands is configurable and is detailed below.
        
        ![](./.github/assets/itomate-demo.gif)
        
        ## Usage
        Open iTerm and simply run the below command
        
        ```shell
        itomate -c config.yml
        ```
        If you don't provide `-c` flag, itomate will look for `itomate.yml` file in the current directory and use that.
        
        Here is the list of options available
        
        ```shell
        itomate [-c,--config <config-file>] # Sets up the iTerm session
                [-h,--help]                 # Shows the help screen
                [-v,--version]              # Shows the installed itomate version
                [-n,--new]                  # Runs itomate in a new window
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        Configuration file to set up the sessions has the format below
        
        ```yml
        version: "1.0"
        profile: "My Profile"
        tabs:
          window-1:
            root: "~/Documents/Projects/my_project"
            title: "Window 1"
            panes:
              - title: "Some Pane Title"
                position: "1/1"
                commands:
                 - !ENV "db authenticate ${DB_PASSWORD}"
                 - "second command"
                prompt: "populated command"
              - position: "1/2"
                focus: true
                badge: "Jobs"
              - position: "2/1"
              - position: "2/2"
          window-2:
            title: "Window 2"
            panes:
              - position: "1/1"
              - position: "1/2"
              - position: "2/1"
        ```
        
        Details for each of the configuration objects above is given below

        | `position` | Position of the pane in the window. It has the format of `number1/number2` where `number1` refers to the column and `number2` refers to the row in the column. More on this later in the readme. `position` is the only required key in a pane   |
        | `focus`    | Pane to be in focus when itomate is finished. `focus: true`. There should only be one focus flag per Tab. If multiple are found, it will focus on the last pane evaluated.                                                                       |

        | `prompt`   | A command which will remain populated in the prompt after all `command`s have finished executing. The `prompt` command itself is not executed automatically.                                                                                     |
        
        ## Environment Variables
        Operating System Environment Variables can be used to create templates with secrets and variables. This allows itomate files to be safely committed to version control. Note in the above configuration example the line using the environment variable is prefixed with the  `!ENV` tag and then uses one or more Environment Variables
        wrapped in the `${ }` syntax.
        
        ## Layouts
        The parameter `position` in each pane decides where each of the window panes will be displayed. The position value has the format below
        
        ```shell
        x / y â€“ both x and y are required parameters
        
        x: refers to the column in the window
        y: refers to the row of the given column x
        ```
        
        Here are some of the examples for different pane layouts
        
        ## Single Pane Window
        
        For single pane, since there is one column and one row, the position for pane would be `1/1`
        ```
        .------------------.
        | 1/1              |
        |                  |
        |                  |
        |                  |
        |                  |
        |                  |
        |                  |
        |                  |
        |                  |
        '------------------'
        ```
        Here is how the configuration would look like
        ```yml
        version: "1.0"
        tabs:
          some-project:
            title: "Some Project"
            panes:
              - title: "Single Pane"
                position: "1/1"
                commands:
                  - "cd ~/Workspace/some-project"
                  - "git pull origin master"
                  - "yarn dev"
        ```
        
        ## Two Panes Vertical Split Layout
        For two panes with equal split or in other words two columns with one row in each, the positions would be `1/1` for the pane on the left and `2/1` for the pane on the right i.e. the second column.
        ```
        .------------------.------------------.
        | 1/1              | 2/1              |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        '------------------'------------------'
        ```
        Here is how it would look in the configuration
        ```yml
        version: "1.0"
        tabs:
          some-project:
            root: "~/Workspace/some-project"
            title: "Some Project"
            panes:
              - title: "First Half"
                position: "1/1"    # <-- Notice the position
              - title: "Second Half"
                position: "2/1"    # <-- Notice the position
        ```
        ## Two Columns, Three Panes Layout
        
        The layout below now has two columns. First column has only one row so position for that would be `1/1`. For the second column we have two panes i.e. two rows; first pane in the second column would be `2/1` and the second one would be `2/2`.
        
        ```
        .------------------.------------------.
        | 1/1              | 2/1              |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |------------------|
        |                  | 2/2              |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        '------------------'------------------'
        ```
        
        Configuration for that would be:
        
        ```yml
        version: "1.0"
        tabs:
          some-project:
            root: "~/Workspace/dev-server"
            title: "Some Project"
            panes:
              - position: "1/1"    # <-- Notice the position
              - position: "2/1"    # <-- Notice the position
                commands:
                  - "./run"
              - position: "2/2"    # <-- Notice the position
                commands:
                  - "git standup"
        ```
        Note that the `commands` and `title` are optional parameters in panes. Only `position` is required.
        
        ## Two Columns, Four Panes Layout
        
        ```
        .------------------.------------------.
        | 1/1              | 2/1              |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |------------------|                  |
        | 1/2              |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |------------------|                  |
        | 1/3              |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        |                  |                  |
        '------------------'------------------'
        ```
        Configuration for that would be:
        ```yml
        version: "1.0"
        tabs:
          some-project:
            root: "~/Workspace/project"
            title: "Some Project"
            panes:
              - position: "1/1"    # <-- Notice the position
                commands:

              - position: "1/2"    # <-- Notice the position
                commands:
                  - "git standup"
              - position: "1/3"    # <-- Notice the position
                commands:
                  - "git standup"
              - position: "2/1"    # <-- Notice the position
                commands:
                  - "./run"

        ```
        Configuration for that would be
        
        ```yml
        version: "1.0"
        tabs:
          some-project:
            title: "Some Project"
            panes:
              - position: "1/1"    # <-- Notice the position
              - position: "2/1"    # <-- Notice the position
              - position: "2/2"    # <-- Notice the position
              - position: "2/3"    # <-- Notice the position
              - position: "3/1"    # <-- Notice the position
        ```

        ## Similar Projects
        
        There is [itermocil](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil/blob/master/README.md) which relies on [Applescript that has been deprecated by iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-scripting.html), has limited layout options, and is pretty limited in terms of what it can achieve because of AppleScript. iTomate on the other hand uses iTerm's [newly introduced Python API](https://www.iterm2.com/python-api/), has flexible layouts support and can be extended using iTerm's pretty powerful API.
