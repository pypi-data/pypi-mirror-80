raytraverse is a complete workflow for climate based daylight modelling,
simulation, and evaluation of architectural spaces. Built around a variance
based adaptive sampling strategy, raytraverse can fully explore the daylight
conditions throughout a space with efficient use of processing power and
storage space.

Installation
------------
The easiest way to install raytraverse is with pip::

    pip install raytraverse

or if you have cloned this repository::

    cd path/to/this/file
    pip install .

note that on first run one of the required modules will download some auxilary
data which could take a minute, after that first run start-up is much faster.

Usage
-----
raytraverse includes a complete command line interface with all commands
nested under the `raytraverse` parent command enter::

    raytraverse --help

raytraverse also exposes an object oriented API written primarily in python.
calls to Radiance are made through Renderer objects that wrap the radiance
c source code in c++ classes, which are made available in python with pybind11.
see the src/ directory for more.

For complete documentation of the API and the command line interface either
use the Documentation link included above or::

    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    make docs

to generate local documentation.

Git Stuff
---------
this project is hosted in too places, a private repo (master branch) at:

	https://gitlab.enterpriselab.ch/lightfields/raytraverse

and a public repo (release branch) at:

	https://github.com/stephanwaz/raytraverse

the repo also depends on two submodules, to initialize run the following::

	git clone https://github.com/stephanwaz/raytraverse
	cd raytraverse
	git submodule init
	git submodule update --remote
	git -C src/Radiance config core.sparseCheckout true
	cp src/sparse-checkout .git/modules/src/Radiance/info/
	git submodule update --remote --force src/Radiance

after a "git pull" make sure you also run::

	git submodule update

to track with the latest commit used by raytraverse.
