Commands
=====================

Here are some descriptions of general commands. You can get the list of the all
commands with a short description by ``zenmake help`` or ``zenmake --help``.
To get help on selected command you
can use ``zenmake help <selected command>`` or
``zenmake <selected comman> --help``. Some commands have short aliases.
For example you can use ``bld`` instead of ``build`` or ``dc``
instead of ``distclean``.

configure
    Configure a project. In most cases you don't need to call this command
    directly. Command ``build`` calls this command itself if necessary.
    This command processes most of values from :ref:`buildconf<buildconf>`
    of a project. Any change in :ref:`buildconf<buildconf>` leads to call
    of this command. You can change this behaviour with parameter ``autoconfig``
    in buildconf :ref:`features<buildconf-features>`.

build
    Build a project of the current directory. It's the main command. To see all
    possible parameters use ``zenmake help build`` or
    ``zenmake build --help``. For example you can use ``-v`` to see more info
    about building process or ``-p`` to use progress bar instead of text logging.
    It calls ``configure`` itself if necessary by default.

test
    Build and run tests of the current directory. If current project has no tests
    it's almost the same as running command ``build``.
    Command ``test`` builds and runs tests by default while
    command ``build`` doesn't.

clean
    Remove build files for selected ``buildtype`` of a project.
    It doesn't touch other build files.

distclean
    Remove the build directory of a project with everything in it.

install
    Install the build targets in some destination directory using installation
    prefix. It builds targets itself if necessary.
    You can control paths with :ref:`environment variables<envvars>`
    or command line parameters (see ``zenmake help install``).
    It looks like classic ``make install`` in common.

uninstall
    Remove the build targets installed with command ``install``.
