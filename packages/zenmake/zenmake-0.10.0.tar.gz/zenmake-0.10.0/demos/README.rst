ZenMake demo projects
=====================

This directory contains demo projects which are used for testing on different
platforms with different toolchains, libraries, etc. Also they demonstrate
use of ZenMake and can be used as examples.

Full list of actual dependencies which are used for regular testing on travis-ci
can be obtained from file '.travis.yml' in the repository root. Different demo
