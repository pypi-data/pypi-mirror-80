  Complexity in this file:
  other_parties[0].gun_license_carry_possess and
  defendant_weapons_safe_for_pdf are weirdly intermingled.
  The latter is in the PDF. The former isn't asked for in
  this file and is only sometimes defined.
  
  Need to ask address to test unit number logic

  Tester: Fill in the values you need for this run
subquestion: |
  Yeah, these don't have any input control. This is not
  a user experience. Follow the scenario for how to fill them
  out.
  
  Note: These gun and alias values are especially bad at testing
