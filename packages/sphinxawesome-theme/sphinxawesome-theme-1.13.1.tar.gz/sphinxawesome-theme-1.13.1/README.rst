Features
--------

The theme includes several usability improvements:

.. features-start

Better code blocks
    - Code blocks have a **Copy** button, allowing you to copy code snippets to the
      clipboard.
    - Code blocks are enhanced with ``emphasized-added`` and ``emphasized-removed``
      options, that highlight removed lines in red and added lines in green.

New directive for highlighting placeholder variables
    The theme supports a new directive ``samp``, which is the equivalent of the
    built-in ``:samp:`` interpreted text role. This allows you to highlight placeholder
    variables in code blocks.

Improved user experience
    A lot of small features make the theme more usable. To name a few:

    - You can tab through headlines and captions enabling easy navigation with the
      keyboard.
    - You can link to admonitions. Their titles have the same “permalink” mechanism as
      headlines and captions.
    - Clicking on the ``#`` icon for permalinks copies the link to the clipboard.
    - Collapsible navigation menu: All elements are reachable from all pages.
    - Keyboard shortcut for the search input: ``/``.
