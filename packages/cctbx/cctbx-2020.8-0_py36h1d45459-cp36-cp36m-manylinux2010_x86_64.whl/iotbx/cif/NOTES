The files cifParser.{h,c} and cifLexer.{h,c} are generated from the file
cif.g using antlr-3.2.jar

Since ANTLR can only generate a C-target for the parser, but we specify our own
C++ code in the grammar actions, cifParser.c and cifLexer.c must be renamed to *.cpp

an example batch file for Windows could be:

set CLASSPATH=.;C:\antlr\antlr-3.2\lib\antlr-3.2.jar
java org.antlr.Tool cif.g

or for Unix:

/usr/bin/env CLASSPATH=/net/cci/auto_build/repositories/antlr-3.2.jar java org.antlr.Tool cif.g

The required anltr jar files can be obtained from:
  http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.2.jar

The runtime libraries and associated files required to build and run the
generated parsers are to be obtained from the antlr3 folder included in
the cctbx source bundles available from
  http://cci.lbl.gov/cctbx_build/all.html
