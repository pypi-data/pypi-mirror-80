# Tensor Canvas ðŸŽ¨
----------------
A 2D graphics library for drawing directly onto tensors.  
Uses [eagerpy](https://github.com/jonasrauber/eagerpy) to support a uniform API for pytorch, tensorflow, jax, and numpy backends.
Tensor Canvas uses SDF representations for easy implementation in gpu-accelerated frameworks.  
Highly inefficient compared to standard gpu rendering, but much better than matplotlib. Integration with ML frameworks also means it is fully-differentiable.

### Example
```python
import tensorcanvas as tc
import torch
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np



```
