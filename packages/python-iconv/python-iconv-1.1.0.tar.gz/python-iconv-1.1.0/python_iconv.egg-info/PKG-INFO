Description: This is a port of Martin v. Loewisâ€™ original iconv package to Python 3.
        
        The iconv module exposes the operating system's iconv character
        conversion routine to Python. This package provides an iconv wrapper
        as well as a Python codec to convert between Unicode objects and
        all iconv-provided encodings.
