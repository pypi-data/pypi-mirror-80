## Goals

There are several goals with this project:

1. Provide a useful API for well developed functions with error catching and testing for commonly annoying situations

2. Provide cross-platform implementations of functions (where possible)

3. Give people access to source code to learn how the functions work and just pull what's needed

4. Serve as a repository of general knowledge to share solutions to issues with people

## Installation

### From PyPi

1. Run ```pip install sdu``` or ```sudo pip3 install sdu```

### From source

1. Clone this repo: (put github/source code link here)
2. Run ```pip install .``` or ```sudo pip3 install .```in the root directory

## Modules

### autocomplete

This module is used to generate autocomplete files for bash


### cli

A module for helpful utilities with generating CLI's such as:


- Clearing the terminal

### paths
This module contains many useful utilities for dealing with system paths such as:
- A pre and post processing pipeline for system paths
- Ability to add paths to the PATH variable

### type_conversions

Quick and common conversions between types with sensible options such as:

- Converting a dictionary (and second dimension dictionary keys) to defaultdict(s)

### validation

Contains a set of common validation schemes such as:

- Validating number input is between a set value at the command line

- Validate provided string is an accepted value
# Changelog

## V0.1.1; September 24th

Fixing logo on pypi :)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed logo 404 on PyPi 

## V0.1.0; September 24th
Focus was on adding more functionality, and modernizing the package setup.

### Features
- Added tests for ```paths```, ```type_conversions``` and ```validation```
- Removed ```type_conversion.stringify_list``` since functionality can be one-lined using ```str.join```
- Added ```type_conversion.dict_to_defaultdict```; Takes in a dictionary, and a default Callable then converts the dict to a defaultdict
- Changed From Apache V2 to MIT liscence
- Added ```paths.add_to_path``` for adding specified paths to system paths
- Added testing for ```sdu.paths```, ```sdu.validation```, ```sdu.autocomplete```, and ```sdu.type_conversions```
- Changed ```sdu.terminal``` to ```sdu.cli```
- Added ```sdu.autocomplete``` for generating bash autocomplete files

### Documentation Improvements
- Changed to second point releases (from 0.0.x to 0.x.0)
- Improved the index documentation to be more clear and concise of an overview
- Added bullet points to each package for a quick overview of what each module can be used for
- Overhauled readme to be more useful

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed some preprocessing bugs with windows in ```path.preprocess_paths()```

## V0.0.1; February 8th 2020

Released existing code for the project, looking to properly implement in v0.1.0

### Features

- Traversing directories in terminal and GUI
- Validating number selections
- Normalized serialization and de-serialization of paths

### Documentation improvements

- Created documentation site
