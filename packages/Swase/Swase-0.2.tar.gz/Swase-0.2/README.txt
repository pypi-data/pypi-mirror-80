-- Swase --
Welcome to Swase!
The better if statement; a switch case statement emulator!

Why use Swase?
If you are a Python developer that constantly uses dozens of nested if-elif statements, This library is just for you!
This library emulates a swase statements from C, C#, C++, etc.
Instead of checking if something is true one after another, it reads a whole list at once and chooses what is correct.
This will massively improve running time!

Does Swase use any other library?
No, Swase runs by itself; no libraries. If I were to use Swase with libraries, It would just make it slower.
