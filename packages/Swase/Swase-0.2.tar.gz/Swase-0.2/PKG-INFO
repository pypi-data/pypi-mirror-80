Description: -- Swase --
        Welcome to Swase!
        The better if statement; a switch case statement emulator!
        
        Why use Swase?
        If you are a Python developer that constantly uses dozens of nested if-elif statements, This library is just for you!
        This library emulates a swase statements from C, C#, C++, etc.
        Instead of checking if something is true one after another, it reads a whole list at once and chooses what is correct.
        This will massively improve running time!
        
        Does Swase use any other library?
        No, Swase runs by itself; no libraries. If I were to use Swase with libraries, It would just make it slower.
