# This is a simple script which will output a single line of info, and exit
# with a return code which indicates status of a given Rattail daemon.  It was
# designed for use with Shinken monitoring.  Invoke like so:
#
#    check-rattail-daemon NAME
#
# Where NAME refers to the service, e.g. 'rattail-datasync'.  Exit code may be:
#
#  * 0 = daemon is confirmed running
#  * 2 = daemon is confirmed *not* running
#  * 3 = unknown state
