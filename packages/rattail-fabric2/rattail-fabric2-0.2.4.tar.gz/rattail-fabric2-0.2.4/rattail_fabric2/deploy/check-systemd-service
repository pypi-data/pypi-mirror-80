# This is a simple script which will output a single line of info, and exit
# with a return code which indicates status of a given systemd service.  It was
# designed for use with Shinken monitoring.  Invoke like so:
#
#    check-systemd-service NAME
#
# Where NAME refers to the process, e.g. 'rattail-soffice'.  Exit code may be:
#
#  * 0 = process is confirmed running
#  * 2 = process is confirmed *not* running
#  * 3 = unknown state
