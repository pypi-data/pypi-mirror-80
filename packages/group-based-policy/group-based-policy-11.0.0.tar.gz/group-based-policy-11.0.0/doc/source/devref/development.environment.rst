      Convention for heading levels in GBP devref:

      -------  Heading 1

      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4
      (Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.)


Setting Up a Development Environment
====================================

This page describes how to setup a working Python development
environment that can be used in developing GBP on Ubuntu, Fedora or
Mac OS X. These instructions assume you're already familiar with
Git and Gerrit, which is a code repository mirror and code review toolset
, however if you aren't please see `this Git tutorial`_ for an introduction
to using Git and `this guide`_ for a tutorial on using Gerrit and Git for
code contribution to OpenStack projects.

.. _this Git tutorial: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started
.. _this guide: http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Following these instructions will allow you to run the GBP unit
tests. If you want to be able to run GBP in a full OpenStack environment,
you can use the excellent `DevStack`_ project to do so. There is a wiki page
that describes `setting up GBP using DevStack`_.

Getting the code
----------------

Grab the code::

    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/group-based-policy.git
    cd group-based-policy
