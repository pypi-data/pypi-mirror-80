        RPBot is a Python script to serialize `Robot Framework`_  output files into
        a ReportPortal. This way the future `Robot Framework`_ related tools and
        plugins will have a unified storage for the test run results.
        
        RPBot is a fork of DbBot-SQLAlchemy project that is using SQLAlchemy in order
        to store test run results in any of the major supported database systems.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        RPBot is tested on
        
        -  `Python`__ 3.5+
        -  `Robot Framework`_ 3.0+
        
        It may (though it is not guaranteed) work with older versions of dependencies.
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        The script takes one or more `output.xml` files as input, and stores
        the respective results into a ReportPortal
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This tool is installed with pip with command:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install rpbot
        
        Alternatively you can download the `source distribution`__, extract it and
        install using:
        
        ::
        
            $ python setup.py install
