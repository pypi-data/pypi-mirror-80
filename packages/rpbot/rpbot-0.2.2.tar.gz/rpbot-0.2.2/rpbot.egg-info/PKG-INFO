Description: ## RPBot
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/doyou89/RPBot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/doyou89/RPBot)
        
        RPBot is a Python script to serialize `Robot Framework`  output files into
        a ReportPortal. This way the future `Robot Framework` related tools and
        plugins will have a unified storage for the test run results.
        
        RPBot is a fork of DbBot-SQLAlchemy project that is using SQLAlchemy in order
        to store test run results in any of the major supported database systems.
        
        ### Requirements
        
        RPBot is tested on
        
        -  `Python` 3.5+
        -  `Robot Framework` 3.0+
        
        It may (though it is not guaranteed) work with older versions of dependencies.
        
        ### How it works
        
        The script takes one or more `output.xml` files as input, and stores
        the respective results into a ReportPortal
        
        ### Installation
        
        This tool is installed with pip with command:
        ```sh
        $ pip install rpbot
        ```
        
        Alternatively you can download the `source distribution`, extract it and
        install using:
        
        ```sh
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
