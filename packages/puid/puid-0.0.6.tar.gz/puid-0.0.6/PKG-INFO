Description: # puid
        
        *puid* provides a function to get the [PRONOM] Unique Identifier for a file. It's
        just a small wrapper around the much more complicated and feature rich [fido].
        
            >>> from puid import get_puid
            >>> get_puid('file.jpg')
            'fmt/42'
        
        puid was created largely for instructional purposes to help students identify
        files in their own Python programs. You will want to use [fido] directly if you
        need to identify files in containers like zip files, or do anything other than
        to get a single PUID for a file.
        
        When you install puid you also get a new command line utility:
        
            $ puid file.jpg
            fmt/42
