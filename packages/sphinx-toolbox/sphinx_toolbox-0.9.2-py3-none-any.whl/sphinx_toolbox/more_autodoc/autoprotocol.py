"""
A Sphinx directive for documenting :class:`Protocols <typing.Protocol` in Python.

Provides the :rst:dir:`autoprotocol` directive to document a :class:`typing.Protocol`.
It behaves much like :rst:dir:`autoclass` and :rst:dir:`autofunction`.

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

.. versionchanged:: 0.6.0

	Moved from :mod:`sphinx_toolbox.autoprotocol`.
