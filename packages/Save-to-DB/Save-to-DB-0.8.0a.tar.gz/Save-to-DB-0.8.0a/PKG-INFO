Description: Save-to-DB
        ----------
        This library can be used to store scraped data from the Internet into a
        database without much effort. It can create, update and delete records in
        database to accommodate new data. It can even configure itself by default by
        getting not null, unique and primary key constrains, foreign keys and other info
        from the database. It can work with Sqlalchemy and Django ORM models without
        much setup. Just throw your data at it and it will take care of storing it
        properly in a database.
