# `psquared_client` project #

The `psquared_client` project container both the `psquared_client` package that
provides a python interface to a PSqaured server, and the `pp-cli` command line
interface that uses that package to all copmmand line access to the server.


## `pp-cli` executable ##

More details about the `pp-cli` executable can be found using its help option

    pp-cli -h

but here are some examples of retrieving information.
(_Note:_ unless  you are using the default local PSquared server you will need to the the environmental
variable `PP_APPLICATION` to point the server you want to use.)

*   To list the currently active configurations

        pp-cli

*   To list the known versions of a given configuration

        pp-cli -i <configuration>


*   To display the current state of one or more items for a configuration/version.

        pp-cli -i -V <version> <configuration> item ...

*   To display the history of one or more items for a configuration/version.

        pp-cli -H -V <version> <configuration> item ...

*   As an alternate, the list of items to be acted upon can be supplied in a file with one item per line.
    Thus the following displays the current state of a set of items listed in a file for a configuration/version.

        pp-cli -i -f <file> -V <version> <configuration>


Here are some examples of commands that affect the state of PSquared.
(_Note:_ you may need an authorized certificate to execute these types of commands.)

*   To submit one or more items for processing with a configuration/version.

        pp-cli -i -s -V <version> <configuration> item ...

*   To resolve the failure of one or more items for a configuration/version.

        pp-cli -i --resolve -V <version> <configuration> item ...

    The other transitions, `submit`, `cancel`, `reset`, 'abandon` and `recover` have similar options.
