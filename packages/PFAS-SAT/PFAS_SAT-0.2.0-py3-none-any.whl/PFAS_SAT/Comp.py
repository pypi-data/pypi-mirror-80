Composting
*************

Composting can accept specific fractions of MSW including food, yard, and some paper wastes. It is also capable of treating dried and
stabilized WWT solids. The primary purpose of composting is to produce a stabilized organic product that can be used as a soil amendment
to enhance water retention, carbon and nutrient content, and erosion control among other potential benefits. In addition to finished compost,
composting systems also produce residual solid materials from pre- and post-screening. Those materials can be combusted or landfilled.
Compost also may produce leachate that needs to be managed through wastewater treatment. It is also possible that PFAS are volatilized
during aerobic composting due to the elevated temperatures and stripping from active aeration, but there is currently no data on this
potential pathway.

In the composting process model, feedstocks (e.g., WWT solids or food waste) are mixed with amendments (wood chips by default) to
increase porosity to allow air flow through the system. Active composting may be under cover or open to the atmosphere. In the latter
case, there will be contact water that may contain PFAS that will need to be managed.

Model predictions are based on achievement of equilibrium. The partition coefficient is used to estimate the concentration of PFAS
in the liquid and solids. The concentration in the liquid is constant throughout active composting on the initial equilibrium concentration.
The model then calculates a fraction of precipitation that becomes contact water. The contact water can either be collected and managed
or be released to surface or ground- water depending on the composting process and applicable regulations. If active composting is under
a cover, then no contact water is included. The PFAS that is not removed in the contact water remains in the compost.

By default, the compost is cured after active composting. The curing model is the same as the active composting model, except it is not
covered and contact water is not managed. Any PFAS that does not leave the curing piles through leaching or run-off, remains in the finished
compost and will be either land applied or landfilled. The behavior of the finished compost in a landfill and land application process are
described in their respective sections. There are several different compost processes (e.g., windrows, static piles, in-vessel). The compost
process model in the SAT framework is designed so that by changing default parameters, any compost process can be represented.

============================
Assumptions and Limitations
============================

1.	Organic carbon partitioning coefficients determined from soils/sediments are used for compost partitioning.
2.	Wood chips are currently the only amendment that is built into the material flow properties.
3.	We assume that the mass of solid loss per carbon loss is similar both for active and curing composting stages.
4.	Volatilization is assumed to be zero by default. However, the user may assign a fraction of the PFAS to be volatilized.
5.	Future work is required to implement a dynamic (i.e., non-equilibrium) model to account for changes in the organic C
    content over time as composted materials decompose, and to account for episodic precipitation events.
6.	We do not consider the possible conversion of "precursor" compounds to commonly measured PFAAs.
