This project was started by Guilherme Lindner as a Master 1 project of the [International Master in Turbulence](http://imp-turbulence.ec-lille.fr), at Ecole Centrale de Lille, under the supervision of Jean-Philippe Laval, Jean Marc Foucaut and Ilkay Solak.
The code was validated and improved by Dr. Yann Devaux at Institute Pprime, Poitiers, France.
