        \* For windows, you need windows-curses to run  
        
        ### Where to get it?
        
        The source code is hosted on GitHub at [mithil467/mitype](https://github.com/Mithil467/mitype)
        
        ```pip install mitype```
        
        That's all if you are on Linux and macOS. If you are on windows, you also need windows-curses, which can be installed from pypi:
        
        ```pip install windows-curses```
        
        ### How to run it?
        
        Once installed, you can run it simply by
        ```mitype```
        OR
        ```python -m mitype```
        
        You can choose difficulty between 1 and 5.
        
        ```mitype -d <value>```
        
        Example:
        
        ```mitype -d 2```
        
        You can use text from a sample file by
        
        ```mitype -f SampleTextFile```
        
        You can quit the app anytime by pressing the *ESC* key or *CTRL-C*.  
        **Note**: If you are in replay mode, currently only *CTRL-C* is supported for exiting.
        
        To directly run from clone without installing:
        
        ```python -m mitype```
        
        You can also directly <a href="https://mitype.mithil467.repl.run/"><img src="https://repl.it/badge/github/Mithil467/mitype"></a> in your web browser.
