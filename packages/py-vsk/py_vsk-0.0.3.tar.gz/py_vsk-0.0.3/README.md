#### Introduction

In the context of statistics, the Vasicek distribution is a continuous distribution governing the open interval between 0 and 1 with two parameters, namely Rho and P, which is similar to the Beta and Kumaraswamy distributions. 

The Vasicek distribution has often been used to describe the portfolio credit loss in the development of Economic Capital models.
