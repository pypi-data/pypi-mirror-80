Description: # dsplab package
        
        ## Fields of application
        
        * Development of software for digital signal processing.
        * Investigation of variety of methods solving the same DSP task.
        * Development of the DSP routines that require a flexible configuration of different stages of calculations on the user level.
        
        ## Features and characteristics
        
        * Some specific functions for analysis of signals.
        * Synthesis of test signals with different kinds of **modulation**: amplitude, frequency and phase.
        * **Playing** of signals (synthesized or archive) for the development of on-line procedures.
        * Organization of calculations, **workflows**:
            - User can define the **plan of works** and then set the **worker** for every work. The replacement of the worker does not destroy the workflow.
            - Different types of nodes are supported: **Work**, **Map (Loop)**, **Select** and **Pack**.
            - Base classes for workers are defined. Every worker can return detailed description of itself by calling **info()** method.
            - Base class for on-line filters having **add_sample()** method and embedded **queues** for running window and smoothing of results is implemented.
        * Licence: **LGPLv3**
        * Programming language: **Python 3**.
