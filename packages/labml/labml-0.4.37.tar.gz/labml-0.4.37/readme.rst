LabML
=====

LabML lets you monitor AI model training on mobile phones.

You just need to create an `experiment <http://lab-ml.com/guide/experiment.html>`_,
and save stats with `tracker <http://lab-ml.com/guide/tracker.html>`_.
You can obtain a token from `LabML App <https://web.lab-ml.com>`_
(`Githup repo <https://github.com/lab-ml/app/>`_).

.. code-block:: python

    from labml import tracker, experiment
  
    with experiment.record(name='sample', exp_conf=conf, token: 'TOKEN from web.lab-ml.com'):
        for i in range(50):
            loss, accuracy = train()
            tracker.save(i, {'loss': loss, 'accuracy': accuracy})

It automatically pushes data to Tensorboard, and you can keep your old experiments organized with the 
`LabML Dashboard <https://github.com/lab-ml/dashboard/>`_

All these software is open source,
and your logs will be stored locally for Tensorboard and `LabML Dashboard <https://github.com/lab-ml/dashboard/>`_.
You will only be sending data away for `LabML App <https://web.lab-ml.com>`_ if you include a token url.
This can also be `locally installed <https://github.com/lab-ml/app/>`_.

LabML can also do a bunch of other things like keeping track of git commits,
handling `configurations, hyper-parameters <http://lab-ml.com/guide/configs.html>`_,
saving and loading `checkpoints <http://lab-ml.com/guide/experiment.html>`_,
and providing pretty logs.
