# factom-py

A python library for working with the primitives of the Factom blockchain.

Alpha software. Development is mainly being done to support a [light node implementation](hydra.md), however, the data structures should be portable enough to use in other application contexts as well.

## Development

For fetching and working with items from a factomd database, see: `tests/db/test_mainnet_db.py`
