        # Filegm
        
        Filegm is a stand-alone script that allows you to search for files in a file system, exclusively according to the parameters of the extension(s) and the date of file creation.
        You can enter a single date, from which to perform the search until today, or a start and end date, within which to perform the search.
        You can then specify one or more file extensions. You can also create a directory in the current folder into which the searched files will be copied.
        Finally, in case there are duplicate files, you can choose whether to copy all duplicate files, a sorting of them, or no duplicate files, to the new
        directory.
