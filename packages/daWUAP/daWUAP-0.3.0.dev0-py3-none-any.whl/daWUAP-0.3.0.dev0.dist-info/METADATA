The data assimilation Water Use and Agricultural Productivity model (daWUAP) is a hydro-economic model that couples an economic model of agricultural production calibrated using positive mathematical programming (PMP) and a semidistributed rainfall-runoff-routing model that simulates water available to producers.

Features:

- Calibration of economic component can use standard the mathematical programming method or a new recursive stochastic filter.
- Stochastic calibration permits to obtain simulation results of agricultural outputs (land and water allocation, etc) as probability distributions that reflect the quality of the calibration.
- Recursive stochastic filter permits calibration of economic model with noisy but frequent remote sensing observations of agricultural activity.
- Model permits to trace the effect of producer choices on the hydrologic system and on other users.
