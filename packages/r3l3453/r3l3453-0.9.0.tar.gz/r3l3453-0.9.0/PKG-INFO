Description: `r3l3453` is a small project that I use for semi-automating release cycle on a few of my projects.
        
        In short what it does is as follows:
        
        * Bump version(s) to a release version according to git log and `Conventional Commits`_.
        * Change the title of `Unreleased`_ section in ``CHANGELOG.rst`` to the new version.
        * Commit changes.
        * Tag the commit.
        * Release to PyPI.
        * Bump the version again to dev0 version for the next release.
        * Push changes to repository.
        
        ``r3l3453.json`` can be used to specify the location of version variables.
        Refer to the ``r3l3453.json`` of this project to see how it is used.
        
        There is a ``--simulate`` cli option which allows one to see what is going to happen.
