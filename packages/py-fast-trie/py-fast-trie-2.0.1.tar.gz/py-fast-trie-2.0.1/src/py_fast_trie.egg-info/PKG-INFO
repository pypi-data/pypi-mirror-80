        py-fast-trie is a package that contains pure-Python implementations of an [X-fast Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-fast_trie) and a [Y-fast trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-fast_trie), as described in the [foundational paper](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/0020-0190%2883%2990075-3).
        
        The most notable benefit of X-fast and Y-fast tries compared to more common data structures such as binary search trees is that searches are log-logarithmic in the cardinality of the universe as opposed to being logarithmic in the number of elements in the structure itself; For reference if you needed to store 2^20 items with a potential maximum value of 2^32 - 1, finding a particular item would take 20 operations in a red/black or AVL tree, but only 5 with an X-fast or Y-fast trie.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The interfaces of the X-fast and Y-fast tries are identical, the Y-fast trie is used here as an example.
        
        	>>> from py_fast_trie import YFastTrie
        	>>> t = YFastTrie(max_length=32)		# The library defaults to the machine's word size
        	>>> for i in range(10, 13):
        	...     t += i					# Value insertion/removal operations have intuitive
        	>>> t.min					# shorthands
        	10
        	>>> t += b'\x0d'				# The library can handle byte strings less than the
        	>>> t.max					# max length by treating them as integers
        	13
        	>>> for val in t:
        	...     print val
        	10
        	11
        	12
        	13
        	>>> t < 12					# Predecessor/successor queries have intuitive
        	11						# shorthands
        	>>> t > 0
        	10
        	t -= 13
        	>>> t > 12
        	>>>
