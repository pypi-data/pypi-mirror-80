Description: # landsat-cogeo-mosaic
        
        Tools to create MosaicJSONs for Landsat imagery.
        
        ## Overview
        
        A [MosaicJSON][mosaicjson-spec] is a file that defines how to combine multiple
        (satellite) imagery assets across time and space into a web mercator tile. This
        repository is designed to be used to create such files, so that they can be used
        for on-the-fly satellite tile generation, such as with
        [`landsat-mosaic-tiler`][landsat-mosaic-tiler].

        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        pip install landsat-cogeo-mosaic
        ```
        
        For CLI commands and some modules, you need additional dependencies:
        
        ```bash
        pip install 'landsat-cogeo-mosaic[cli]'
        ```
        
        ## Create Mosaics
        
        In order to create the mosaic, you need the metadata on where and when Landsat
        took images, and also the cloud cover of each image. There are a couple ways to
        get this data. One is to ping the [Sat
        API](https://sat-utils.github.io/sat-api/) hosted by Development Seed. This
        allows you to find the metadata from specific regions and times, and is easier
        when you're creating a mosaic for a specific region.
        
        Alternatively, for large mosaics it's easier to do bulk processing. In order to
        not overload the Sat API, I download a file from AWS with metadata from all
        images.
